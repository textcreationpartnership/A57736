            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT is the chief point of Wiſdom, to know what is true happineſs: If we place happineſs in that which is not happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we ſhall be deceived ſo much the more at laſt. The things of this world cannot be happineſs to us, becauſe the ſoul muſt live beyond them: when the ſoul is gone out of the body, it ſees it ſelf incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with broad and vaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: and when it is in its <hi>ſeparate ſtate,</hi> it meets with none of thoſe ſenſible Objects,
<pb facs="tcp:62027:3"/>which it endavoured to ſuck contentment from, whilſt it lived in the body: at what a loſs then muſt that ſoul be for happineſs, who knew no other happineſs, but what was to be taken in from ſenſible things?</p>
            <p>The deſigne of this <hi>ſmall Tract</hi> is to put us upon the contemplation of that which muſt be happineſs to us at laſt. It is no difficult thing for us to come in our thoughts, to the end of all thoſe things which now we take comfort in: Life it ſelf, and all the comforts of it, muſt ſhortly have an end. Now ſince all theſe things muſt have an end, a ſhort and ſpeedy end, it may not ſeem unreaſonable for us to conſider what the next ſtate of things is like to be, and what it is that muſt make us happy at laſt.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.18.</note> 
               <hi>The things that
<pb facs="tcp:62027:3"/>are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> The minde of man is not quieted (neither indeed can it be) until it meets with ſomething that will be happineſs to it; and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meets with happineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it ſindes all the good it would have, and alſo knows it ſhall have that good always, without diminution, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or ceſſation. God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is an infinite and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal good. Nothing can be happineſs to the reaſonable creature, but to enjoy him as the chief good, and to acquieſce in him as its laſt ond; and then is the minde quieted, when it comes to ſix and reſt in him. The ſcope of the whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe is, to gather in our ſouls from ſenſible things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to ſix them in the contemplation of that
<pb facs="tcp:62027:4"/>which muſt be our happineſs at laſt. That which was mainly deſigned in the firſt Part, which concerns <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs,</hi> was to make ſome Eſſay how we might be brought to ſome ſuitableneſs and conformity to the life of Heaven, and to ſhew (ſo far as we could) how we might be led into the beginnings of that life here on earth: And that is the true reaſon, why that which concerns that Matter is more inſiſted on, and drawn out to a greater inlargement then might ſeem preportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reſt of the Diſcourſe. The other Part, which concerns <hi>Earthly-mindedneſs,</hi> was not to be omitted, becauſe it lyes ſo full in the Text; and too ſad experience teacheth, that we need not more to be ſtirred up to the deſire and love of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things, then we do need
<pb facs="tcp:62027:4"/>to be warned againſt the love of this World, which is the <hi>great Rock</hi> upon which many Profeſſors ſplit their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and indeed, the great obſtacle which keeps them off from the purſuit of eternal things. All that I ſhall add more, is, that if Divine Grace help us to get up a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into the Spirit of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life, I am perſwaded we ſhall finde it the ſweeteſt frame of ſpirit whilſt we live, and to be ſure, moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us when we come to dye. I doubt not, but upon experience this will be found true, that the firm and ſtedfaſt belief, the deſire and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal things, is much more ſweet then the highest injoyment of temporal things: And it will be no grief of heart to us when we come to dye, that we have been a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb facs="tcp:62027:5"/>with, and in ſome ſort accustomed unto that life here on earth, which must be our life when we enter into the other world, and muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be ſo unto Eternity.</p>

                  </note> Calvin</hi> obſerves, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth here exhort us to the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62027:6"/>on of the <hi>Heavenly life.</hi> We finde it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult for us to get up our hearts into Heaven: we are moſt prone to ſtick in this earth, and to riſe no higher in our thoughts and affections then viſible things; and therefore there is great need that this duty of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> ſhould be preſſed upon us. Now the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds his exhortation, whereby he preſſeth us to the Duty of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> two manner of ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Affirmatively.</item>
               <item>2. Negatively.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. Affirmatively, in two expreſſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Seek thoſe things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> in the firſt Verſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Set your affections on things that are above,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verbum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitandi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis exprimit aſſiduitatem ſtudii, &amp; vehementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ac ſi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret, ſit haec tota vestra meditatio, huc ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, huc ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</note> in the ſecond Verſe. The Apoſtle aims at one and the ſame thing in both expreſſions. <hi>Seek thoſe things that are above: Set your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things that are above:</hi> All that the Apoſtle aims at in both is this, that he would have us to be <hi>Heavenly-minded;</hi> onely to inforce the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the more, he repeats and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles it; and the variation of the phraſe adds ſome more weight to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62027:6"/>exhortation: we muſt not onely <hi>ſeek,</hi> but <hi>ſet</hi> our <hi>affections</hi> upon the things which are above. It is not enough for us to ſeek the things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in any manner, or after any ſort, in a careleſs indifferent way; but we muſt <hi>ſet our affections</hi> upon theſe things; that is, our hearts muſt be taken up in them, theſe muſt be the great things that muſt take up our ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Apoſtle having propounded this exhortation affirmatively, he comes to propound it negatively, at the latter end of the ſecond Verſe: <hi>Not on things which are upon the earth: Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</hi> So that as the Apoſtles ſcope is to preſs us to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs,</hi> ſo his deſigne alſo is to preſs us to a holy contempt of this world, and to take us off from an inordinate minding of earthly things. The Spirit of God foreſaw how prone our hearts were to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with this world, and with earthly things; and therefore he is not content to preſs us to the duty of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> in general, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62027:7"/>gives us an expreſs and particular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the love of the things of this world: <hi>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</hi> Now then this being the Apoſtles ſcope to preſs us to <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs;</hi> and to take us from <hi>earthly-mindedneſs;</hi> there are ſeveral Motives he uſeth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, to inforce theſe things upon us.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Motive</hi> or <hi>Argument</hi> the Apoſtle uſeth to preſs this duty of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> is taken from the conſideration of our <hi>fellowſhip</hi> or <hi>communition</hi> with Chriſt: <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above.</hi> A Believer is riſen with Chriſt, and therefore he ought to ſeek the things which are above. Although Believers have not as yet attained to glory in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet they have attained it in the perſon of their Head: A Believer is riſen in Chriſt, aſcended in Chriſt, glorified in Chriſt his Head. Chriſt's Reſurrection, Aſcention, Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a pledge and an earneſt of his Reſurrection, of his Aſcention, of his Glorification: Therefore eternal life and glory being ſecure to us in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62027:7"/>Chriſt, and we having a right and title to it in our Head, it becomes us to ſet our hearts on that which is our proper inheritance. We are riſen with Chriſt, that is, in Chriſt our Head; we have a right and title to Heaven and Glory: therefore Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Glory being ſecure to us in Chriſt our Head, who hath taken poſſeſſion of it in our name and ſtead, we ought to ſet our hearts upon that which is our great and proper inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. That is the firſt Motive, the conſideration of our fellowſhip and communion with Chriſt; <hi>we are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with Chriſt.</hi> A Believer hath glory already given him in his Head, he is deſtinated unto glory, and this his Head hath already taken poſſeſſion of in his Name and ſtead.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Motive to preſs us to <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> and to take us off from <hi>earthly-mindedneſs,</hi> is taken from the conſideration of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate. A Believer's preſent ſtate is a <hi>dead ſtate: Ye are dead,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>verſe</hi> the third. Seek the things that are above, ſet your affections on things that are above; <hi>for ye are dead.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62027:8"/>Ye are dead;</hi> that is, dead to the world, dead as to any earthly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Your happineſs lyes not in the rode of this world. <hi>Ye are dead;</hi> that is, ye are like to dead men: though you have a life in this world, yet the life you have in this world as men (not to ſpeak of your life as you are Saints) it is but a dead kinde of life; though you may have ſome comforts and enjoyments in this world as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, yet they are all as dead comforts and enjoyments in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what is your true happineſs; your true happineſs is to live with God and Chriſt. The Apoſtle hints ſo much, that true happineſs is to live with God and Chriſt, as he ſaith afterward; <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> therefore your preſent life and comforts are all dead things in compariſon of what is your true life and happineſs. Now if a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be dead to the world, if all his happineſs in this world be but the picture and ſhadow of true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then it is all the reaſon that his heart ſhould be taken off from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and ſet upon that which is indeed his happineſs.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62027:8"/>
            <p>The third conſideration to preſs us to <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> is, that a Believers life is a <hi>hidden life: You are dead, your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> A Believers true life, his true happineſs, lyes not within ſight, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in view, it is <hi>hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> If we will finde out true happineſs, we muſt not look for it in the rode of preſent ſenſible things, but we muſt look for it with Chriſt in God: <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Mark it, if we would finde out true happineſs, we muſt conſider what it is that Chriſt as man, and as the Head of the Church, injoys in the preſence of the Father. A Believers happineſs lyes in communion with his Head, in enjoying bleſſedneſs in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Father, like unto that which Chriſt as man injoys now in the preſence of the Father. <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lyes not in any thing in this world, but your happineſs is of the ſame kinde as Chriſts happineſs is: look what happineſs Chriſt as man injoys in the preſence of the Father,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62027:9"/>that is your happineſs, and nothing elſe. Now this being a Believers true happineſs, it concerns him to clevate his thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto the things that are above, <hi>where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Motive the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle uſeth to preſs us to the duty of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> is the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the certainty that is given to a Believer of future glory. A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath already a title to glory in Chriſt his Head; yea, after a ſort, he hath an inchoate poſſeſſion of it, foraſmuch as Chriſt is poſſeſſed of Glory in his name and ſtead; but at laſt a Believer ſhall be brought to a full, perfect, compleat poſſeſſion of glory in his own perſon, as now he hath it inchoatively in the perſon of his Head. This the Apoſtle intimates in the fourth verſe: <hi>When Chriſt</hi> who <hi>is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory;</hi> that is, we ſhall <hi>actually</hi> appear with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that is, as another Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>We ſhall be like him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>We know when he ſhall appear,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62027:9"/>we ſhall be like him.</hi> Look what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is given to Chriſt the Head of the Church, the ſame glory in a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be given to the Members. Now then the future happineſs of the Saints being ſo ſure, it being as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they ſhall have it, as if they had it in hand; the glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Heaven being no notion, no fiction, but as ſure as Chriſt is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſo ſhall all his Members be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; then certainly it becomes Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to ſet their hearts upon theſe things. Theſe are the Motives the Apoſtle makes uſe of to preſs the great duty of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> upon us.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What are theſe things above that we are to ſeek after, and to ſet our affections upon?</p>
            <p>This ſhall be opened in four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By the <hi>things above,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> we ought to <hi>ſeek the things that are above;</hi> that is, we ought to converſe much in our thoughts with God and Chriſt. That theſe are the things above here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is clear from the Context: <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek the things which are above:</hi> What follows? <hi>where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God;</hi> it is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Chriſt is above, and God is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62027:10"/>above; now let your hearts be upon theſe things: <hi>Seek the things which are above, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God;</hi> that is, let your thoughts dwell much upon God and Chriſt. So at the third verſe, <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> If our happineſs lye hid in God and Chriſt, then we do <hi>ſeek the things which are above,</hi> when our hearts are mainly and principally carryed out after God and Chriſt, in whom onely our true happineſs is to be found, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Truely our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When may our fellowſhip be ſaid to be with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt? Certainly one way whereby we have fellowſhip with the Father and Jeſus Chriſt, is this; when we converſe much in our thoughts with God and Chriſt; that is, when God and Chriſt have more of our thoughts then any earthly thing. <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> then do we <hi>ſeek the things above,</hi> when our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taken up about God and Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62027:11"/>to know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> The perfect knowledge of God and of Chriſt, is our perfect happineſs in Heaven; and ſo much as we do know of God and Chriſt here on earth, ſo much happineſs do we enjoy here on earth: there is more ſweetneſs, more comfort, more ſatisfaction to be taken in from the knowledge of God and of Chriſt here on earth, then from all earthly injoyments whatſoever: might it not ſeem too much for me to ſpeak, I might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſay, Though it be but a little of God and Chriſt that I know, yet I would not exchange or part with the thoughts of God and Chriſt, which are to be had in this world, for all the Kingdoms upon earth. Now if the thoughts of God and Chriſt, and the little knowledge that may be had of God on earth, have ſo much ſweetneſs in it; what will the viſion of him in heaven? and what will the perfect knowledge of him there be? When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the higheſt thing he could do for the Saints, it is this, that they might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62027:11"/>have a greater meaſure of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Chriſt: let us conſider the Text, for it is a great Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>For I would that ye knew what great conflicts I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not ſeen my face in the fleſh; that their hearts might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknowledgement of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt.</hi> See with what a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Preface the Apoſtle uſhers in this deſire. 1.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 1. The Apoſtle teacheth us here, that the knowledge of God is a Myſtery <hi>to the riches of the full aſſurance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to the acknowledgement of the myſtery of God:</hi> There is a great <hi>Myſtery</hi> in the knowledge of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> poor creatures that we are, we are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62027:12"/>apt to think we know enough of God at firſt; but there is a <hi>Myſtery</hi> in the knowledge of God; and what this Myſtery is, the Apoſtle tells us, it is the <hi>myſtery of the Father, and of Chriſt:</hi> And what is this Myſtery? what is this <hi>myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt?</hi> So far as we can conceive of it, it lyes in this, to know God in the <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Divine Eſſence, to know God in the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Perſons, to know Chriſt as Mediator, and to be able to apprehend the Father in Chriſt: it is the <hi>myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> to be able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Father in Chriſt, as Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father;</hi> that is, to apprehend the Divinity to be ſo in Chriſt, as that we ſee, that by having the Son we have the Father, and in poſſeſſing Chriſt we poſſeſs whole God. This is the Myſtery of God the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, and we have reaſon every day to be more and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into it, to labour to come to a clear knowledge of it. That is the firſt thing; there is a Myſtery in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62027:13"/>the knowledge of God. 2. The Apoſtle would have them to come to the <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to the <hi>acknowledgement of the myſtery of God;</hi> that is, he would have them to come to a clear and diſtinct knowledge of all the Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Chriſt: the word ſignifies an accurate,

Phavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus.</note> or more exact conſideration of a thing: after the firſt perception of it, we have ſome knowledge of God and Chriſt at firſt; but we muſt labour to come to a more accurate exact knowledge of God and Chriſt. 3. The Apoſtle would have them come to the <hi>riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding.</hi> 1. Here is <hi>riches,</hi> that ſets forth <hi>copiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>abundance:</hi> The Apoſtle would not have them have ſome ſlender taſtes of God and Chriſt onely, but he would have them inriched with the knowledge of God and Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. <hi>This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more, in knowledge, and in all judgement.</hi> 2. He would have them labour to attain unto the greateſt <hi>certainty</hi> and aſſurance in their knowledge; he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62027:13"/>would have them come to the riches of the <hi>full aſſurance of underſtanding.</hi> This <hi>full aſſurance of underſtanding,</hi> I take to be oppoſed to wavering and to doubting: The Apoſtle would have us to come to a certainty in our knowledge: A Chriſtian ſhould not be fluctuating and heſitating in his thoughts concerning God and Chriſt; but he ſhould endeavour to come to this, that he may be able to ſay, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this bottom I can live and dye; that which I know concerning God and Chriſt is ſuch a bottom, that I can venture my hope, my happineſs, my all upon. This I take to be the meaning of that expreſſion, the <hi>full aſſurance of underſtanding.</hi> Now theſe are the things above that we are to ſeek, and to ſet our affections upon, <hi>viz.</hi> God and Chriſt; our thoughts are to be converſant about theſe things; we ought to be taken up in the ſtudy of the <hi>myſtery of God and Chriſt:</hi> and then do we ſeek the things that are above, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe much in our thoughts with God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the things above, we are to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62027:14"/>underſtand <hi>the glory and bleſſedneſs of heaven;</hi> by the things above (ſaith a Learned man) we are to underſtand <hi>the kingdom of heaven,

This is alſo to be gathered from the context; <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek the things which are above, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God;</hi> as much as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, When I ſpeak of the things above, I intend nothing elſe but ſuch things as are in Heaven, ſuch things as Chriſt injoys in the preſence of the Father. <hi>Seek the things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God:</hi> It is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, conſider what it is Chriſt now injoys in the preſence of the Father; conſider what glory Chriſt is poſſeſſed of: Chriſt is above ſorrow, above pain, above miſery, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove death: Chriſt enjoys perfect
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62027:14"/>happineſs in the preſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; now conſider what Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, and theſe are the <hi>things which are above.</hi> This is manifeſt to be the Apoſtles ſcope, from the fourth verſe, <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory:</hi> It is as much as if it had been ſaid, Chriſt is now in glory, and we ſhall one day be made like our Head, <hi>we alſo ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi> The Apoſtle would have us to minde this, to think what that glory is, that Chriſt our head is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, and what the glory is we ſhall be brought unto, in conformity to Chriſt our Head: the Head and Members muſt be like one another; if Chriſt be now in glory, the ſame glory is prepared for all that are Chriſts; and this appears from our Saviours laſt prayer, <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one, Joh.</hi> 17.22. Therefore look what glory Chriſt as man and Head of the Church injoys, we in our meaſure ſhall have a ſhare in, if we be Chriſts, and Members of his Body. This
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62027:15"/>then we are to underſtand by the things above, <hi>the glory and bleſſedneſs of the future ſtate.</hi> I have often thought there is nothing we are more want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defective in then this, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſtudying and contemplating what the <hi>glory and bleſſedneſs of the future ſtate is;</hi> we ſtick in preſent ſenſible things, and do not elevate our hearts to the future glory: but we ought to be of another frame;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>He looks to the things which are not ſeen;</hi> that is, unto the things of the inviſible world, to the glory of heaven, and the bleſſedneſs of the Saints there: elſewhere he ſaith, <hi>He reckons that the ſufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18. that was an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had his heart taken up with the glory of that ſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the things above, we may underſtand, <hi>the life and imployment of the ſaints in heaven,</hi> and <hi>our communion with God in heaven:</hi> we ought to <hi>ſeek the things above;</hi> that is, we ought to think much of our future life, and conſider what our life and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62027:15"/>in eternity is like to be: though this be of near affinity with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe our happineſs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the glory and bleſſedneſs of that eſtate conſiſts in the life we ſhall live there; yet we may conſider this under a diſtinct head; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conſideration of this will help to illuſtrate the former particular: The Apoſtle tells us, when we are <hi>abſent from the body,</hi> we <hi>ſhall be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. From this Scripture we may argue, If when we are <hi>abſent from the body,</hi> we are <hi>preſent with the Lord,</hi> then there is a life in which the ſoul ſhall live with God, when it is in a ſeparate ſtate from the body, a life that we ſhall live in the Divine Preſence. Now this is to <hi>ſeek the things that are above,</hi> to conſider what the life is that we ſhall live in the preſence of God and the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, when we have laid down this burden of fleſh, and are diſcharged from the body of death, and ſhall be made free among the heavenly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and admitted into the number of the Spirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; to know what our life and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62027:16"/>imployment ſhall be in that ſtate, this is to <hi>ſeek the things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi> Though we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend fully and perfectly what this life will be, yet we may underſtand a little of it, as the Scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it: the Scripture teacheth us thus much, that hereafter we ſhall walk by ſight, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. Now <hi>we walk by faith, not by ſight:</hi> That intimates, when the life of faith ends, then the life of ſight and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begins. Here indeed we live the life of faith, hereafter we ſhall live the life of ſight and viſion; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> The Scripture teacheth us, when we ſhall appear, <hi>we ſhall be like him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. So that our life in heaven is ſo far revealed in the Scriptures, that it is <hi>to ſee God,</hi> to be <hi>like him;</hi> that is, that we ſhall live a life like to his life, ſo far as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable.

<note place="margin">Davenant.</note> As by the things above we ought to underſtand <hi>the glory and bleſſedneſs of heaven</hi> primarily, ſo ſecondarily and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially, by the things above we are to underſtand thoſe gifts of Grace, which are as the ſeeds of this deſired Glory; as Faith, Love, Holineſs, and the reſt of the Graces of the Spirit, by which we are brought to eternal Glory. The Graces of the Spirit may well be called <hi>the things that are above,</hi> becauſe (as <hi>Anſtine</hi> expreſſes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62027:17"/>it) in reſpect of their excellencie they do excel all <hi>earthly</hi> things. So then as we ought to <hi>ſeek the things above</hi> in this ſenſe, that is, ſeek after the glory and bleſſedneſs of Heaven; ſo we ought to ſeek that Grace that hath a tendencie in it to bring us to this glory. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded.</hi> How would the Apoſtle have us minded? he would have us minded like himſelf: and what was <hi>Pauls</hi> frame? read the former verſe; <hi>I preſs toward the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that is, <hi>I preſs towards the mark</hi> of perfection: Why ſo? <hi>for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I would get as high in grace here, as is poſſible, that I might be fit for glory hereafter: I preſs toward perfection in Grace, as that which is the way to bring me to that Glory. <hi>As many as be perfect be thus minded:</hi> The meaning is, If you would approve your ſelves to be grown Chriſtians, excellent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chriſtians of the higheſt rank and form, aim at perfection; look
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62027:17"/>at the higheſt attainments in Grace here, that ſo you may be fitted for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter. So that to <hi>ſeek the things which are above,</hi> is to ſeek for a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs &amp; a meetneſs for the future life and ſtate. It is a great expreſſion which we have, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. <hi>If ſo be that being clothed, we ſhall not be found naked.</hi> The Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the glory of Heaven, and of the Saints entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that glory in their ſouls, when their body is diſſolved. Now the Apoſtle's jealouſie is this, <hi>If ſo be that being cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſhall not be found naked;</hi> that is, leſt he ſhould be deſtitute and void of thoſe graces, ornaments, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual affections, that might render him in ſome meaſure ſuitable to that ſtate. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Saints to furniſh themſelves with variety of grace, all ſorts of grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Add to your faith vertue;</hi> and ſo one grace to another: And what is the end? that they might be brought to a greater ſuitableneſs to the future life; ſo we have it at the eleventh verſe: <hi>For ſo an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance ſhall be adminiſtred unto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly into the everlaſting kingdom
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62027:18"/>of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, If you add grace to grace, and grow to a greater excellencie in every grace; <hi>So there ſhall be an abundant enterance adminiſtred to you into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo that, this is to <hi>ſeek the things which are above,</hi> when we minde and intend the acquiring and getting of grace above any earthly thing; when by the ſtrength of Chriſt, and the grace of Chriſt in us, we are ſtill poliſhing and refining our ſouls, growing up to more ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and aſpiring to get higher and higher in grace, that ſo we may be more and more fitted for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bridegroom, and that we may be found <hi>ready,</hi> as it is ſaid of the Bride the Lamb's Wife, ſhe had <hi>made her ſelf ready.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 19.7.</note> So that when we are trimming, and refining, and poliſhing our graces in the ſtrength of Chriſt, and endeavouring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a greater ſuitableneſs to the heavenly life, then do we <hi>ſeek the things which are above.</hi>

            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62027:18"/>
            <p n="2">2. I come now to the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, to ſhew what it is to <hi>ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to ſet our affections</hi> upon theſe things.</p>
            <p>This we ſhall open in a few Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To <hi>ſet our affections on things above,</hi> it is to <hi>think</hi> much of theſe things: If we would <hi>ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the things above,</hi> our thoughts muſt be much imployed about theſe things:
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> This word tranſlated <hi>ſet your affections,</hi> elſewhere is tranſlated to minde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Thoſe that are after the fleſh, do minde the things of the fleſh.</hi> So here, we are exhorted to minde the <hi>things which are above:</hi> the meaning is, we ſhould cauſe out mindes and thoughts to be occupyed and taken up about theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ought to think of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> of inviſible things; we ought to think that the <hi>the things which are above</hi> are real things, ſubſtantial things: many do not think them to be ſo: a great many think, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſpoken of the other world, and of the bleſſedneſs of the Saints above, it is but a fiction and a fancie: this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62027:19"/>is the temper of the Atheiſtical age in which we live; but we ought to think of theſe things as realities, as the greateſt realities: <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. Faith ought to make that preſent and real to us, which is remote from ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to think of theſe things, ſo as to ſtudy the nature and excellencie of theſe things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ought to think of them; that is, our thoughts ought to dwell upon them: we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have tranſient thoughts of theſe things, but we ſhould dwell much in the Meditation of theſe things. This is one thing implyed in that expreſſion, <hi>ſet your affections;</hi> that is, ſet your thoughts <hi>on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> let your minde dwell on theſe things.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To <hi>ſet our affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> is to <hi>value</hi> and <hi>eſteem</hi> theſe things above all other things. The Criticks in the Greek tongue obſerve, that the word (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) ſignifies to value and eſteem a thing, as (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62027:19"/>to under-value and deſpiſe a thing; and this appears by the Text it ſelf: <hi>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</hi> The Antitheſis and oppoſition that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, ſhews what we are to underſtand by ſetting <hi>our affections on things above. Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth;</hi> as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, Have the higheſt value for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things; ſet the higheſt price upon ſpiritual things; eſteem ſpiritual things above all earthly things. This value and eſtimation of ſpiritual things <hi>Paul</hi> had, when he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>I count all things but loſs and dung for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi> Spiritual things bught to bear the greateſt weight in our thoughts; we ought to approve them as the beſt things, and ſee a far greater excellencie in them, then in all temporal things.
<note place="margin">Davenant.</note> There is a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that obſerves upon this Text; this word tranſlated to <hi>ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> comprehends two acts in it: 1. It notes the act of the minde or underſtanding, when it thinks of any

               </gap> will or affections, approving or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a thing: ſo that to <hi>ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on things above,</hi> is to approve of them in our eſtimation as the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That you may approve the things which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. To <hi>ſeek the things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> it is to intend theſe things as our principal aim and ſcope, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the kingdom of God;</hi> that is, let your principal aim and ſcope be to get an intereſt in the <hi>kingdom of God:</hi> So here, <hi>Seek the things which are above;</hi> that is; let your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal aim and ſcope be to acquire and get theſe things: let the main bent and tendencie of your ſouls lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe things. Every rational Agent that acts out of reaſon and underſtanding, intends ſome end; now that which the Apoſtle would preſs us to, is this, to intend and deſigne ſpiritual and eternal things as our great end. There is no man but he hath ſome laſt end that he proſecutes; now that which the Apoſtle would preſs us to, is, to make eternal things
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62027:20"/>(the things of the other world) our great and laſt end: as much as if he ſhould ſay, Whereas others are ſurſuing after other things, Riches, Honour, Pleaſures, and making them their uttermoſt end; do you intend another end; do you make God and Chriſt, and the things of other world, your principal aim and ſcope. <hi>Seek the things that are above:</hi> Two are implyed in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make this your end, to make ſure your intereſt in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Get a holy meetneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs of Spirit to injoy theſe things.</p>

            <p n="2">2. As we ſhould make ſure our intereſt in theſe things, ſo we ſhould make this our end, to get a <hi>holy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

Now then, if our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts in what Chriſt enjoys, then it becomes us to ſtudy and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate much what the happineſs and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62027:25"/>glory of Chriſt is, and what our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs will be in conformity to what our Head enjoys; we ſhall never be happy till we are arrived to that happineſs Chriſt is poſſeſſed of. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> in his Book <hi>Contra Gentes,</hi> lays down this as one poſition, That mans <hi>laſt happineſs</hi> cannot be in <hi>this life;</hi> and there are many arguments he gives to prove it, among which theſe are ſome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One reaſon why our laſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be in this life, is, becauſe we cannot ſee God as he is; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee God in his Eſſence (as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is) here on earth:
<note place="margin">Per eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</note> 
               <hi>No man can ſee my face and live,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Our mortality will not bear the ſight of God face to face. Now without the clear ſight and viſion of God, there cannot be perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for <hi>this is life eternal,
<note place="margin">John 17.3.</note> to know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Argument that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs cannot be attained in this life, is, True happineſs can never be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs the natural deſire and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite which is in man, be ſatisfied:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62027:26"/>then is a man happy, when he enjoys all the good he would have: if there be any good wanting to a man he would have, ſuch a man cannot be happy, becauſe his deſire and minde is not quiet: Happineſs conſiſts in this, when the minde hath all it would have: Now there is no man knows or injoys ſo much here on earth, but he ſtill deſires to know and injoy more: now until the natural appetite, which is in man, be filled up, there cannot be perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>A third Argument is this: Mans natural deſire is carryed out after ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in happineſs; as every man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires happineſs, ſo he deſires a <hi>ſtable</hi> happineſs: if a man have that which he accounts happineſs, unleſs it be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conſtant to him, ſuch a man hath not attained to true happineſs; for it is of the nature of happineſs to be unchangeable: that which is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be loſt or interrupted, is not worth the name of happineſs. Now there are many accidents that may occur, that may interrupt the beſt happineſs we can have here on earth;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62027:26"/>and whilſt there is a poſſibility that a mans happineſs may be interrupted, the midne cannot be quieted, as to the injoyment of what it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends as its chief good. Now if a mans laſt happineſs cannot poſſibly be attained in this life, it concerns us to have our thoughts elevated to the other world, and to minde that ſtate where true happineſs is indeed to be found.</p>

It is a great expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>We labour, that whether preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we may be accepted of him.</hi> He had ſaid in the verſe before, <hi>We are confident, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord. Paul</hi> was confident, that when his body was diſſolved, he ſhould immediately be with God in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that his ſoul ſhould be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory: this was his confidence; <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we labour, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But here the great Inquiry will be,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may we get more up into the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of Heaven? ſince a great part of our ſeeking the things above, conſiſts in a conformity to the Heavenly life; how may we do to get more up into the ſpirit and frame of the Saints in Heaven? This is a noble Inquiry, and deſerves to be the matter of our ſtudy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation all our days. What is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62027:29"/>the great concernment of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but (after he hath gotten into Chriſt, and hath gotten ſome aſſurance he is in the ſtate of Salvation) to be working up his heart into the ſpirit of the future life? A <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> hath two great Works to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in this world: firſt, to make ſure his title to Salvation, to pray for a more clear and diſtinct underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his union with Chriſt, that he may ſee he hath a ſound title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and glory. Secondly, to pray for Grace, that God would work up his heart into the Spirit of the future life, that ſo he may be adapted and ſuited to that life, and brought to as great a conformity to it, as may be here on earth. Now what Directions may be given us as to this, to bring us more up to the ſpirit and life of heaven here on earth, before we come to be taken thither in perſon? This being the main thing intended in the whole Diſcourſe, I ſhall take liberty to be a little large here; and there are many particulars that muſt be ſpoken unto.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62027:29"/>he <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Heaven, let us begin by degrees to withdraw our hearts and affections from preſent ſenſible things. What is the life of Heaven but this? <hi>God ſhall be all in all:</hi> hereafter we ſhall live upon God purely, and immediately, without all creatures; therefore by degrees we ſhould labour to have our hearts more taken out of the creature, and gathered into God. Miſtake me not, whilſt we are here on earth, we muſt uſe the creatures, and it is the will of God we ſhould uſe them; and not to uſe them to thoſe ends God hath appointed them, were to tempt God, and make our ſelves wiſer then God: But here lyes the skill of a Chriſtian, while we do uſe the creature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſenſible things, ſtill to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſee God in every creature, and to paſs from every creature to God: not to ſtick in the creature, but to paſs from the creature to God, and then, to think of ſuch a time when we ſhall live upon God without theſe things.

            <p n="2">2. If we would get up into the life and ſpirit of Heaven, <hi>let us minde a ſpiritual happineſs, ſeek after a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62027:31"/>happineſs, and be taken up in the thoughts and deſire of a ſpiritual happineſs:</hi> The happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is mainly and principally a <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and an intellectual happineſs:</hi> the happineſs of God himſelf is a <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, an intellectual happineſs:</hi> The Being of God is a ſpiritual being, and the happineſs of God is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual happineſs ſuitable to his Being: God hath no other happineſs, then to know himſelf, and underſtand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The happineſs of the Saints and Angels is a <hi>ſpiritual intellectual happineſs.</hi> The Angels and Souls of glorified Saints are ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and therefore their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt needs be a ſpiritual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The Angels and glorified Saints have no groſs material objects to live upon, they have no other happineſs then what they take in by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and wills. O conſider it, true happineſs conſiſts mainly and principally in what the ſoul injoys: not but that the body ſhall at laſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of happineſs with the ſoul: when the body ſhall be raiſed, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall participate in its kinde with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62027:31"/>the happineſs of the ſoul: but the Eſſence of true happineſs lyes mainly and principally in what the ſoul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys; and that appears from thoſe words of our Saviour:
<note place="margin">John 17.</note> 
               <hi>This is life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, to know thee the onely true God.</hi> It is the ſoul that is capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enjoying God; and therefore true happineſs and eternal life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts properly in what the ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys. <hi>Senſual minded</hi> men are apt to think there is no happineſs but what the body enjoys, and is taken in by the ſenſes; but true happineſs is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, and it conſiſts in what the minde injoys: There is more true happineſs which the minde takes in, in one ſingle thought of God, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the body and outward ſenſes can take in by all the variety of objects that are moſt pleaſing to them: look as the underſtanding or minde in man is a higher principle then ſenſe is in a brute; and as the objects of the minde are higher and more excellent then thoſe of ſenſe; by ſo much the more is the minde or underſtanding capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of taking in a greater happineſs then ſenſe can do. Senſe in a brute
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62027:32"/>is capable onely of taking in preſent mutable things; the underſtanding is capable of converſing with eternal and immutable things: therefore that which quiets the minde moſt, which is of the greateſt capacity, that muſt needs be the greateſt happineſs. The minde of man covets eternal things, and is ſatisfied with nothing but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things; therefore to know that a man is in the love and favour of God, whoſe love or hatred is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; to know that a man ſhall be freed from everlaſting miſery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; to know that a man ſhall be happy in living with God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: theſe are eternal things, and ſuch things as will quiet the minde of man.

Now when the ſoul is in a juſtified ſtate, when it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it ſelf reconciled to God, this brings in inward quiet, the peace of God that paſſeth all underſtanding. So in <hi>Sanctification,</hi> when the work
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62027:32"/>of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is begun, we are in ſome meaſure brought to a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and likeneſs unto God, and there is an harmony and an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our wills and the Divine Will. Now from this conformity unto God, and the agreement and harmony that is between our wills and the Divine Will, there ariſeth peace: This is certain, ſo much holineſs, ſo much peace: we ſhould therefore look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſpiritual happineſs, an happineſs conſiſting in peace of conſcience, in the apprehenſion of the ſavour of God, an happineſs conſiſting in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſo much true peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo much holineſs, ſo much true happineſs: This is the beginning of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life: <hi>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The happineſs of Heaven conſiſts in this, that we ſhall be filled with Grace, and the Spirit of God: In Heaven the Spirit of God ſhall act us perfectly and univerſally; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more Grace, and the more of the actings of the Spirit of God we feel in our ſelves here on earth,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62027:33"/>the more we have of the beginning of heaven, of the beginning of eterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the ſoul is full of Grace, and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, then it knows God perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (ſo far as the creature is capable) it loves him and delights in him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and then it is moſt happy: I ſay, when Grace is perfected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated, and the operations of the ſoul are carried higheſt in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace, then is happineſs moſt compleated. This ſhould cauſe us to covet Grace and the Spirit of God in the higheſt manner; we ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Grace and the Spirit of God more then any temporal thing: Certainly ſo much of Grace, and of the Spirit of God as we feel working in our ſelves, ſo much may we perceive of the dawnings of heaven and eternal life in our ſouls: He that feels much of the preſence of the Spirit of God in his ſoul, and feels the lively ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actings of Grace in his ſoul, may know he hath the beginning of heaven
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62027:33"/>in himſelf. Let us covet a ſpiritual happineſs, a happineſs conſiſting in the exerciſe of Grace, and in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual actings of the ſoul upon God: we ſhould often think with our ſelves, What is it that muſt ſatisfie the ſoul to eternity? ſuppoſe I had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoyment of ſenſible things, would theſe things ſatisfie me? what is it that my ſoul can reſt in ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately? what is it the minde can be quieted with? If I know I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, if I know I ſhall one day certainly injoy God, and live with him for ever; here is ſome ſtay and quiet for the minde; this will quiet the minde more then all ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things can do. Happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the higheſt operations of the minde; therefore when the minde is moſt carried out after eternal things, which are moſt ſuitable to the minde, then it injoys moſt happineſs: A great part of the happineſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven conſiſts in this, that the Saints know, what happineſs they do now injoy, they ſhall always enjoy: If it were poſſible that ſuch a thought could be let into their mindes, that

Onely let us take this Caution: When we ſay that we ſhould depend on God immediately, and expect all from God immediately, the meaning is not, as if we might not make uſe of the creatures as helps appointed by God in their proper places: we may and ought to uſe the creatures, in that way, and for thoſe ends unto which God hath appointed them; but take heed you expect not too much from the creature: our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ought to be raiſed above the creature; we ought to conſider, no creature can do us good, but as God puts virtue into it, makes uſe of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62027:39"/>it for our good, and as God acts it and communicates himſelf by it; our great dependance therefore ought to be upon God himſelf above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If we would come more up into the life and ſpirit of the Saints in heaven, <hi>we ſhould labour to take up our reſt and ſatisfaction in God.</hi> The Saints in heaven are perfectly ſatisfied with God, and in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>When I awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs:</hi> that is, when I awake in the morning of the reſurrection, I ſhall be ſatisfied with the viſion of thy face. The ſight of God is the moſt ſatisfying ſight, and that will appear from theſe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. 1. Becauſe the Saints in ſeeing God, ſee all things in God; there is nothing in the effect, but what is in the cauſe; the Saints by ſeeing God, muſt neceſſarily ſee the perfection of all things in him. 2. The Saints in ſeeing God, are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the uttermoſt perfection, beyond which there is no perfection. That which cauſeth unquietneſs in the minde of man here in this world,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62027:40"/>it is, becauſe when he hath found one good, ſtill he thinks yet there is a higher good; and when he hath found that, ſtill he thinks there is a higher to be enjoyed: but when the ſoul once comes to the higheſt good, which is truely ſo, and knows there is no higher, then it reſts and quiets it ſelf here. Now the Saints that are come to the ſight of God, know there is no higher good then God, therefore their mindes are ſatisfied in God. 3. The Saints in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, behold infinite perfection; they ſee that in God, that will fill their capacity brim-full; now then the Saints having their uttermoſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty filled, this is that which muſt needs breed perfect ſatisfaction. So then, if the Saints in heaven are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſatisfied in God, and deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then what they have in God, we ſhould labour to come up to this ſpirit, to be ſatisfied in God, and with God: We ſhould reſt in God as in our Centre, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn O my ſoul unto thy reſt.</hi> Though we deſire many things for our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as food, raiment, outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62027:40"/>and the like; yet we ſhould covet nothing as our reſt but God: Here is my reſt, whether I have much or little, want or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, God is my reſt; we ſhould labour to ſay ſo inwardly, ſenſibly and experimentally, that God is my reſt, I need nothing as my happineſs but God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If we would get more up into the ſpirit and life of heaven, <hi>Let us look down upon all the things of this world as poor and mean things.</hi> The Saints in heaven, who live with God, and have the ſight of him, ſee that in him, and have that before their eyes, which makes all the things of this world ſeem poor and mean to them.

This is a great piece of heaven, when we make the Will of God the ground of our acquieſcence and ſatisfaction: God hath willed it, and therefore we acquieſce. It is one thing to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a mans condition from ſome <hi>moral</hi> conſiderations, and another
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62027:42"/>thing to make the Will of God the ground of our ſatisfaction and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence: the ground of our ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ought to be, God hath willed ſuch a thing, therefore I acquieſce: the perfection of a created will, is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Divine and increated Will.</p>

If we would get up into the life and ſpirit of heaven, <hi>Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hour to be more deeply ſenſible of the infinite diſtance that is between God and us.</hi> In heaven, the Saints and Angels are moſt ſenſible of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between God and them: the more perfect our knowledge of God is, the more clearly ſhall we diſcern the diſtance that is between God and us: the more clearly we underſtand the Divine perfection, the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall we ſee our infinite diſtance from God. This is certain, The clearer our knowledge of God is, the greater foundation there is for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: Never ſo humble a creature as the <hi>humane ſoul</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt; and the reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt as man had the moſt perfect knowledge of God; and Chriſt knowing God moſt perfectly, he underſtood the diſtance
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62027:42"/>that was between his Humanity and the Divinity: therefore this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, The clearer our knowledge is of God, the more humble-ſhall we be. When the Lord ſate upon the Throne, the Seraphims covered their faces, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.1, 2. and what did that ſpeak, but the deep ſenſe that they had of the infinite diſtance that was between God and them? The moſt perfect <hi>creature</hi> in its kinde, a <hi>glorified</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is but a creature: now between the creature and the Creator, there is an infinite diſtance: the more we are reduced and ſunk down into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs in our ſelves, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the infinite diſtance that is between God and us, the nearer do we come to the ſpirit of heaven. In heaven we ſhall moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtand our dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, that the creature is a meer dependent thing; and if God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract and withdraw from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what he hath given to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the creature vaniſhes into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: the creature is nothing, hath nothing, but what it hath received; if God abſtract what he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62027:43"/>the creature returns to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. O labour to keep up a deep ſenſe of the infinite diſtance that is between God and us.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If we would come more up into the ſpirit of heaven, <hi>Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to hate ſin, not onely becauſe of the effects and conſequents of it</hi> (as <hi>that it is damning,</hi> and the like) <hi>but becauſe it is an uncomely thing in its ſelf, and becauſe it is contrary to the purity and perfection of God, who is the firſt and moſt perfect being, and the rule and meaſure of all good.</hi> This is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſpirit of heaven; the Saints in heaven having the ſight of God, muſt needs ſee and know how contrary ſin is to God; they ſee clearly that ſin is contrary to the <hi>being of God,</hi> to the <hi>purity of God,</hi> to the <hi>life of God,</hi> to the <hi>will of God,</hi> and to the <hi>glory of God:</hi> and therefore they muſt needs hate it as ſuch. The Saints alſo in heaven ſee how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin is to their own beings, and to that rectitude that is put upon them, they being made of God to be ſuch creatures as they are; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their own being, as they are

It hath been ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how we ought to breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beatifical viſion: that which now we are ſpeaking of, is to ſhew that we ought to covet after the knowledge of God in a way of Faith; we ſhould covet after the knowledge of God, which is to be had from the Word, and is poſſible to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto here on earth. Here we <hi>walk by faith, not by ſight,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. although we cannot know God in a way of viſion, as we ſhall know him hereafter, yet we may know him in a way of Faith: Now we ſhould covet to know God in a way of Faith, as he hath revealed himſelf in his Word; we ought to prize and covet after the knowledge of every truth of God, but eſpecially we ought
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62027:44"/>to covet after the knowledge of God himſelf, who is <hi>prima Veritas,</hi> the firſt original Truth.

Certainly, if our ultimate and laſt happineſs be to know God in the way of the <hi>beatiſical viſion,</hi> the next happineſs to this, it is to know God
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62027:45"/>as he may be known here on earth: and this will be found in experience to be true, that there is more true ſweetneſs to be taken in from the knowledge of God that is attainable here on earth, then there is from the enjoyment of any temporal thing: And therefore holy ſouls are wont to bleſs God more, for revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Son to them, then for the greateſt temporal thing he ever gave them. God is the higheſt and moſt Supream Object that the minde of man can converſe with: and the more the minde of man is taken up in the contemplation of this Supream Object, the greater amplitude, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and inlargement will it finde in it ſelf.

The Saints in heaven have the ſame judgement and eſtimation of things that God hath; they will what God wills, they love what he loves, they delight in what God delights, they a in at the ſame ends that God aims at. The Divine underſtanding is the meaſure of Truth, and the Divine will is the meaſure of Good: what God judges to be beſt, the Saints in heaven judge
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62027:49"/>to be ſo; what God wills to be beſt, the Saints will it as ſuch. God va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues holineſs and ſpiritual excellencies above external things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.10. <hi>He delights not in the ſtrength of the horſe, he takes not pleaſure in the legs of a man.

God knows that he doth moſt for a man, beſtows moſt favour upon him, when he gives him moſt grace, and not when he gives him any temporal thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holy ſouls think ſo too. God wills holineſs, loves holineſs, and delights in holineſs; and therefore the Saints in heaven muſt needs will it, love it, and delight in it. The Life of God is to know himſelf, to behold his own excellencies, and to refer all things to himſelf; and the life of the Saints in heaven is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template God, and to refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to God: we ſhould labour and pray to be brought to as great a conformity to God here
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62027:49"/>on earth, as it is poſſible. <hi>Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy: be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.</hi> We would labour to have the ſame thoughts and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things as God hath: we ſhould have the ſame value and eſtimation of holineſs as God hath: we ſhould labour to have the ſame hatred of ſin as God, the ſame love and delight as God hath. God loves himſelf, and delights in himſelf above all things; and we ſhould love God, and delight in God above all things. God wills his own glory infinitely, and we ſhould will it to the uttermoſt of our poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. This is to come up to the life and ſpirit of heaven, when we labour for affections and diſpoſitions moſt like to God, when we are brought up to as near a ſimilitude to the Divine life, as it is poſſible.</p>
            <p n="16">16. If we would come up to the ſpirit and life of heaven, <hi>Let us va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue all our comforts by what we ſee of God in them:</hi> the ſtate of heaven is deſcribed by this; <hi>That God ſhall be all in all.</hi> What is that? among other things, this is certainly one thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62027:50"/>in that expreſſion: the Saints in heaven ſee God in all things, and all things in God; and every thing is amiable to them, as they ſee God in it, and no farther. It is a memorable paſſage of a Modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; <hi>We ſhall,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in heaven ſee God, and imbrace him in our ſelves, out of our ſelves, and in all things; ſo that though we ſhall ſee all the holy Prophets, Patriarchs, Martyrs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our own kindred and acquaintance, yet all our affections ſhall reſt in one God by Chriſt.</hi> Nothing is ſweet to the Saints in heaven, but as they ſee God in it; and nothing ſhould be ſweet to us, but as we ſee God in it: we ſhould labour to ſee God in every thing, finde out God in every thing, and paſs from every thing to God: The beſt injoyments, the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, the beſt conditions in this world are pitiful things, poor, dry, ſapleſs things, any further then we ſee God in them. God is the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>every</hi> good; and if God be the good of every good, then nothing is truely good but as we ſee God in it. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract and take God out of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62027:50"/>any condition, any injoyment; that creature, that condition, that injoyment, is but a dry husk, a ſhell without ſubſtance. Our great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and infelicity in this world, is, that we ſtick in the creature, and forget God; we do not riſe up in our thoughts to God: all particular and inferiour goods, are ſubordinate to the univerſal and ſupream good; and they were given us on purpoſe to lead us by the hand to the chief good, and when we ſtick and reſt in any lower and inferiour good, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the true end for which theſe things were given us by him, and that was to bring us to the chief good. They are memorable paſſages which <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy man is he, which knows all theſe things,</hi> (meaning created things) <hi>and knows not thee; but bleſſed is he that knows thee, although he knows not thoſe things: and he that knows thee and them too, is not the happier becauſe of them, but it is by thee onely that he is happy.</hi> And it is a memorable compariſon which that holy man uſeth: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the bridegroom ſhould make a ring for his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62027:51"/>ſpouſe, and ſhe when ſhe had received that ring, ſhould love the ring more then her husband who had made her that ring; would there not an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous minde appear in her, towards the gift of her husband, although ſhe loved nothing but what her husband had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her? For this certainly did the bridegroom beſtow that pledge of his love upon her, that he himſelf might be beloved in his own love-token: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God given thee all thoſe things, that thou mighteſt love him, who gave thee thoſe things: It is more that he would give thee, to wit, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who gave thee thoſe things.</hi> This is <hi>Auſtin's</hi> compariſon. O let us not ſtick in the gifts of God, but let us labour to ſee God in his gifts, and paſs from the gifts to the Giver.</p>
            <p n="17">17. If we would come up into the life and ſpirit of heaven, <hi>Let us be much in acts of praiſe and adoration.</hi> That which we call <hi>praiſe,</hi> is nothing elſe but the declaring and ſetting forth of anothers excellencie; and <hi>adoration</hi> is the giving of honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and reſpect to another, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the excellencie that is in him:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62027:51"/>Praiſe may be given to the creature, but Adoration is to be given to God onely: <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve. Adoration</hi> is due to God onely; and the reaſon is, becauſe in God onely is the Supreme Excellencie: and the moſt Supreme Honour is due to the Supreme Excellencie. Now the life of heaven is the life of praiſe and adoration: the Seraphims ſay, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hoſts, Iſai.</hi> 6. and the heavenly hoſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. cry, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt.</hi> Praiſe and adoration is the proper work of heaven. In heaven there will be no room for prayer, becauſe in heaven there will be no wants, no imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and there is no good the Saints can deſire, but they will be ſure to have; but praiſe will ſtill remain. The Divine Excellencie is ſtill the ſame; and whilſt the excellencie of God remains to be the ſame, there will be ſtill matter for praiſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration: It will be matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Saints and Angels, to behold the glory of the Divine Majeſty. Saints and Angels will wonder at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62027:52"/>perfection of the Divine being: they will not wonder at the being of God ſimply conſidered; that is, they will not wonder that there ſhould be ſuch a one as God; for then they will know and underſtand moſt clearly, that the being of God is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; that God always was, is, and ſhall be; and that he could not but be: but that which they will wonder at is this, they will wonder at the greatneſs of Gods Majeſtie, when they ſee the divine excellencie to be ſo much above their comprehenſion; they will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee ſo glorious a being as God; and they will wonder at the divine goodneſs, that he ſhould make ſuch creatures as they are, to behold his perfections. We ſhould therefore inure our ſelves to acts of praiſe and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here on earth: let us be much in admiring and adoring the divine perfection; this will bring us neereſt the life of heaven.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If we would come up to the life and ſpirit of heaven, <hi>Let us labour for the moſt perfect love one to another.</hi> The Saints in heaven, as they have the moſt perfect love to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62027:52"/>God, ſo they have the moſt perfect love each to other: the Saints in heaven do not grudge one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they do not envie each others happineſs: the Saints in heaven take complacencie in the good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of each other, as well as in their own good and happineſs. It was an Expreſſion I once heard from an holy man; <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come to that piece of heaven, that I do not envie any one that is above me.</hi> Certainly it is a great piece of heaven, that we ſhall not envie the gifts and graces of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: nay, if we are come into the ſpirit of heaven, we ſhall heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the gifts and graces of others. A ſpirit of envie is moſt contrary to the ſpirit of heaven: for, in heaven we ſhall rejoyce in what God hath done for others, as well as in what he hath done for our ſelves: and the reaſon is, becauſe in heaven we ſhall not look ſo much at our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate happineſs, but we ſhall look at the glory of God. Now becauſe God is glorified in doing good to others, as well as to our ſelves; therefore we ſhall rejoyce that God is glorified in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62027:53"/>what he hath done for others, as well as in what he hath done for us.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed, according to the meaſure that I have attained, how we may get a little up into the life and ſpirit of heaven. I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how far ſhort the beſt of the Saints come, as to the full attaining unto theſe things: yet theſe are the things we ſhould be aſpiring and reaching after; and ſo far as we can in any meaſure and degree attain to theſe things, ſo far ſhall we feel the buddings, and perceive the dawnings of eternal life in our own ſouls: and how ſweet is it to have experience of ſuch a life began in our ſouls here on earth, as ſhall never expire or have an end? This natural life which now we live, is but a poor dying thing at beſt; O but this ſpiritual life which hath been diſcourſed of, if ſo be we can but feel the beginning of it in our ſouls, O then we have that life ſet up in us that ſhall never end. So far as we finde theſe holy diſpoſitions grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in us, we ſhall evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the dawnings of eternal life in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62027:53"/>our own ſouls: wherefore let us make it our ſtudy and buſineſs all our days, to be growing up more into the ſpirit of heaven: the more we ſtudy theſe things, and meditate on them, the more reaſon ſhall we ſee, why we ſhould prize ſuch a life, and labour to get up into it.</p>
            <p>It remains onely now, that I ſhould ſhew you what the principal <hi>Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> are, and ſo I ſhall put an end to this Doctrine. There are ſeveral <hi>Impediments</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt grand impediment of Heavenly-mindedneſs is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief. Faith is the ſubſtance of things not ſeen, the evidence of things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11.1. It is the property of faith, to make <hi>abſent</hi> things preſent; to give things that are abſent to ſenſe, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence by faith in the ſoul. Now if a man want that faith that ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize future things, and give them a ſubſiſtence in his minde; it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that his heart is not carried forth in deſire after them. The affections follow the apprehenſions of the mind:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62027:54"/>if a man do not apprehend future things to be real or certain, it is no wonder if he do not affect them. Now the greateſt part of men look upon nothing as real or certain, but what is obvious and preſent to ſenſe: they doubt and ſuſpect the truth of all that which is ſpoken concerning a future life, and a future ſtate: a man will never part with or forgo a <hi>certain</hi> good for an <hi>uncertain:</hi> Riches, honours, pleaſures, the comforts of this life, men look upon as preſent and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but the joys of heaven, the bleſſedneſs that is above, the pleaſures that are at Gods right hand, they look upon as things at a diſtance, and uncertain; and therefore they will not quit their intereſt in preſent things, for the hope of future things. This <hi>evil heart of unbelief</hi> in men, is that which cauſeth them <hi>to depart from the living God:</hi> and this unbelief is too prevalent in the hearts of the godly themſelves. The holyeſt men, and thoſe that have moſt grace, are moſt ſenſible of the buddings and puttings forth of unbelief within them: although they do not queſtion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62027:54"/>the truth of the future life, and of the future ſtate, as other men do; yet they complain that they do too often finde ſecret doubts ariſing in their hearts about theſe things: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a ſeed of faith, yet it is not ſo actuated as it ought to be: for if we had ſuch a firm and deep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief about future things as we ought, it is not poſſible that we ſhould be ſo much captivated by preſent things as we are. Certainly, the deep, rooted, ſtedfaſt belief of eternal things, would produce other effects, and another kinde of change then what is found in the moſt of our hearts. It were not poſſible we ſhould live as we do, had we a clear proſpect by faith of eternal things. Therefore as ever we deſire to be <hi>heavenly-minded,</hi> we muſt pray that this <hi>evil root of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> might be eradicated and taken out of us: and we ſhould pray, 1. That God would clear up the eye of our faith, that we may more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>diſcern</hi> and <hi>apprehend</hi> the things contained in the promiſes. 2. We ſhould pray that we may give a more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62027:55"/>
               <hi>firm aſſent</hi> to the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning future things, and may not ſtagger at the promiſes through unbelief. 3. We ſhould pray that we may live much in the hope and expectation of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the things contained in the promiſes. It is a proper Scripture to illuſtrate this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. <hi>We are ſaved by hope.</hi> The meaning of that Scripture I take to be, The grace of hope doth <hi>gradually</hi> bring us into the poſſeſſion of Salvation: Therefore doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>If we hope for that we ſee not, then we do with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wait for it:</hi> It is as much as if it had been ſaid, By a patient expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to us, we are gradually brought into the poſſeſſion of the things we hope for: If our hope do not ſlack or fail, but we are ſtill kept up in the expectation of what God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, our hope ſhall at laſt be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into fruition and poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond impediment of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs,</hi> is <hi>want of more experience in divine and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.</hi> He that hath taſted of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62027:55"/>ſweetneſs of Gods preſence here on earth, cannot but be meditating and longing after the full enjoyment of that preſence hereafter. It is reported of <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his <hi>life,</hi> That his deſire was not ſo much of any thing here on earth, not of gold, or ſilver, or precious ſtones; not of honours, or dignities, or of the pleaſures of the fleſh; nay, not ſo much of thoſe things as were neceſſary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life: but all his deſire it was of the Lord himſelf, whoſe name was a refreſhment to him, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of whom was his conſolation: They are expreſſions that he himſelf uſeth: <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſince I have learned thee, thou abideſt in my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there do I finde thee; when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, I am delighted in thee; theſe are the delights which thou haſt given me.</hi> The ſweetneſs which the Saints finde in God, keeps their hearts fixt and intent in the thoughts of him; and the more they taſte of the ſweetneſs of his preſence here on earth, the more ſweet is it to them to think what God will be to them hereafter. <hi>How great is thy goodneſs
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62027:56"/>which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee? Pſal.</hi> 31.19. The Saints taſte a little here, but they know there is much more laid up then ever yet they took in, or can take in here on earth: It is but a ſip, a taſte they have here, but the full draughts are reſerved till hereafter. Now want of more experience of the ſweetneſs of God's love and preſence here on earth, is one cauſe why we are no more taken up in the meditation of what we ſhall injoy hereafter: we think there are no higner delights then what are to be injoyed in ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things; but we ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>his loving kindeneſs is better then life,</hi> and <hi>one day in his houſe is better then a thouſand.</hi> It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath, <hi>So great is the bleſſedneſs that is to be found in Gods preſence, that if we could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide no longer in it then one days ſpace, innumerable days in this life, filled up with the confluence of all earthly goods, were to be deſpiſed in compariſon of it: for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this was not ſpoken out of miſtaken affection, when that holy man ſaid, One day in thy houſe is better
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62027:56"/>then a thouſand.</hi> Now we taſte but little of this preſence here on earth, and therefore we deſire and long no more, and are looking no more into what we ſhall injoy hereafter. The Apoſtle prayes for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they might abound more and more <hi>in knowledge and in all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Phil.</hi> 1.9. In all <hi>judgement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> or in all <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or in all <hi>experience,</hi> we ought to abound in ſpiritual ſenſe and experience, as well as in knowledge: we content our ſelves with a notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge of God and of Chriſt, but we ſhould pray for ſpiritual <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> as well as knowledge. <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> the more experimental ſenſe we have of the ſweetneſs of God and Chriſt in our own ſouls here on earth, the more ardent will our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires be after the full injoyment of him in heaven; and the more ſhall our hearts be fixt and ſet upon the contemplation of what we ſhall there injoy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another great impediment of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> is <hi>ſenſuality, and too much addictedneſs to preſent things:</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:62027:57"/>It is the property of <hi>ſenſuality</hi> to be converſant about <hi>preſent things.</hi> The Schools obſerve, the motions of <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality</hi> do tend to ſuch things onely as are delectable to the outward ſenſes; <hi>ſenſuality</hi> mindes nothing but the delights of the body. Now this principle of <hi>ſenſuality</hi> pulls us down ſo much to theſe inferiour things which are preſent, and occur to ſenſe, that we cannot riſe up in our thoughts to things that are abſent, and out of ſight: <hi>Senſuality</hi> is like a plummet of lead that hangs upon the ſoul, and preſſeth it down, and hindereth it from riſing up unto its proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: it hinders the ſoul from aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the contemplation of God and eternal things.
<note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> 
               <hi>If the minde have that from whence it may be delighted from without, it will remain without delight from within.</hi> Senſuality is a ſtrong and forcible principle; it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us with a great force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and with a great impetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to thoſe things that delight the ſenſes; and ſo ſtrong is the power of ſenſuality, that it oftentimes capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the will and underſtanding,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62027:57"/>and draws thoſe ſuperiour faculties of the ſoul after it: ſo ſtrongly is ſenſe bent and ſet upon its object, that it violently hurries the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will, and cauſes the minde to think of nothing elſe, and the will to purſue nothing elſe, but what ſenſe is inclined unto. When the ſoul is in this hurry, it cannot be free for the contemplation of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: holy contemplation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a free, ſedate, ſerene, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed ſoul. When the ſoul is bent downward to temporal and earthly things, it cannot riſe up to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of eternal things.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another impediment of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs</hi> is <hi>unmortified luſt.</hi> When the Apoſtle had exhorted us here in the Text, <hi>To ſeek the things which are above,</hi> he bids us in the next place, to <hi>mortifie our members which are upon the earth:</hi> Intimating this, that without the mortification of our luſts, we ſhall never be fit to practice the great duty of <hi>Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Mortifie your members which are upon the earth.</hi> Why members <hi>on the earth?</hi> becauſe corrupt luſts,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62027:58"/>they do always tend to <hi>earthly</hi> things, and they do detain and keep the minde to <hi>earthly</hi> things onely. Now theſe <hi>fleſhly luſts,</hi> they are ſaid to <hi>war againſt the ſoul,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. One unmortified luſt draws the ſtrength of the ſoul after it, and therefore they are ſaid to war againſt the ſoul. Fleſhly luſts hinder the ſoul in the purſuit of its great intereſt: the great intereſt of the ſoul is to injoy God, and maintain communion with God: Now unmortified luſt carries the ſtrength of the ſoul another way, and ſo it hinders the ſoul in its aſcent to the chief good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another impediment of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly - mindedneſs is multiplicity of worldly buſineſs, and immoderate cares about the things of this life,</hi> Luk. 21.34. <hi>Take heed leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and drunkenneſs, and cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi> Here are two impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by our Saviour: The firſt is ſenſuality, comprehended in thoſe words: <hi>Take heed leſt your hearts be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62027:58"/>overcharged with ſurfeiting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs.</hi> A man that is given up to thoſe luſts, ſurfeiting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a <hi>ſenſual-minded</hi> man, he is drowned in <hi>ſenſuality.</hi> The other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment is <hi>the cares of this life.</hi> When a man is oppreſt with worldly care, this hinders him in his preparation for death and judgement. A man that is involved in multiplicity of worldly buſineſs, and oppreſt with earthly cares, hath no time or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to think of his ſoul, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on eternity, and to contemplate the things of the other world: His head and heart is ſo full of other things, that he hath no time or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to minde eternal things: It is the wiſdom of a man that would keep his ſpirit free for God, not to thruſt himſelf into more worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances then needs he muſt. It is true, if God call a man to more then ordinary work or buſineſs, if his call be clear, he may expect ſo much the more grace and aſſiſtance; for God is not wont to be wanting to us, when he gives us a call: but when a man out of a covetous humour

But then as the neglect of a lawful Calling is one extreme, ſo too much worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, too much incumbrance about earthly things more then we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, is another extreme, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proves a great impediment to <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs.</hi> How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a man ſhould be free for God, and heavenly things, that is wholly drunk up and immers'd in the cares of the world?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another impediment of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs,</hi> is <hi>inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to lawful things.</hi> When a man loves lawful things <hi>inordinately,</hi> and <hi>too much,</hi> this is a great impediment to <hi>heavenly-mindedneſs.</hi> If any thing have more of the heart then God and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62027:59"/>Chriſt, that muſt needs hinder the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the ſoul to its proper object. <hi>Where a mans treaſure is, there will his beart be:</hi> if a mans treaſure be above, if he account it his great happineſs to live with God, and to enjoy him for ever; ſuch a man will keep his heart free for God. A man who is <hi>heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,</hi> whoſe treaſure and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in heaven, is moſt careful to keep his heart free for God: he is moſt curious and jealous over his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, fearing leſt any thing ſhould have that room and place in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſhould be reſerved for God and Chriſt. When we let out our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction inordinately, beyond due bounds and meaſure; when we <hi>over-love</hi> the creature, and <hi>over-delight</hi> in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; this is a great impediment to <hi>heavenly-mindedneſs.</hi> Nothing <hi>can be</hi> that to us, which God and Chriſt is; nothing <hi>ought</hi> to be that to us, which God and Chriſt is. Holy and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſouls are wont to ſay as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> doth, <hi>There is no reward more ſweet to be had from God, then God himſelf: whatever God gives thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelf, is leſs then himſelf.</hi> Now
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62027:60"/>when we ſet up the creature in the place of God, and give that to the creature which is due to God onely; this muſt needs be a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>heavenly-mindedneſs.</hi> A man that would be <hi>heavenly-minded</hi> whilſt he is uſing lawful things, ought to think with himſelf, Theſe things are good for preſent uſe, theſe things are ſuitable to my preſent ſtate, theſe things are good ſo far as I ſee God in them; but theſe things are not my happineſs; my happineſs is a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our happineſs; my happineſs is to live with God and Chriſt in the other world: therefore though I uſe theſe things, I ought not to think them to be my chief good, nor to take up my reſt in them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another impediment of <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs,</hi> is <hi>too much addictedneſs to the love of this life.</hi> We are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding loth to think of going hence; we would fain live a little longer here on earth, that we might ſolace our ſelves in outward comforts and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This addictedneſs to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, is a great impediment to <hi>heavenly mindedneſs.</hi> He that would
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62027:60"/>be <hi>heavenly minded,</hi> ought to ſit looſe from this world, and the preſent life: he ſhould be able to think with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of going hence, and entring into the future ſtate: the thoughts of the <hi>divine preſence</hi> into which we are to enter, ſhould <hi>wean</hi> us from this world, and the love of this preſent life. We ſhould labour to have ſuch great thoughts of the <hi>Divine preſence</hi> into which we are to enter, that it ſhould not be grievous to us to part with this world, and all creatures, and to part with this life to go into that <hi>preſence:</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. <hi>Abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord.</hi> No ſooner do we leave the body, but preſently and immediately (if we be the Lords) we enter into the <hi>Divine preſence.</hi> Now the thoughts of that <hi>preſence</hi> ſhould ſo over-power our ſouls, that we ſhould be willing to quit our ſtation here, to enter into that preſence.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62027:61"/>We are ſo much wedded to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, ſo much addicted to preſent things, that we cannot riſe up to the contemplation of eternal things: we cannot be willing to forgo this life, and preſent things, to go to God, and live with him in his eternity. This fondneſs of the preſent life, is a great impediment to <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Another impediment of <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs,</hi> is <hi>preſumption of long life.</hi> The generality of men are apt to think it is ſoon enough to think of eternity and the future life when they are grown old, or brought into ſome great ſickneſs, ſo that they have no hope of a longer life: and we are apt to think of a long life here on earth: we are too apt to preſume there are ſome more years we may live, and this inclines us to think how we may make the beſt of this world while we live in it; and ſo we put off the thoughts of the future ſtate. But we ought to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frame and temper; we ought to pray as <hi>Moſes</hi> did,

Death may ſurpriſe us before we are aware; and to be ſure, we cannot live long, much leſs always here on earth: this therefore is true wiſdom, to conſider how we are like to ſpend the days of eternity, and what the life is we are like to live in the other world. A wiſe man will conſider the end of things; he will conſider how things are like to be with him at laſt. True wiſdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the longeſt ſtate and duration of things. To preſume of a long life here on earth, which if it were the longeſt, is not ſo much as a moment to eternity, and to forget the future ſtate, which is everlaſting, this is the greateſt folly.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Another impediment of <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedneſs,</hi> is <hi>a falſe opinion of the world, and of earthly things.</hi> Men think there is more good, more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, more ſatisfaction in the world,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62027:62"/>then indeed there is to be found in it. No man will minde and look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an abſent and an unſeen happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when there is an happineſs, as he imagines, that is preſent, and lies before him. The world lies before men as a fair and a pleaſant field, and there are variety of flowers appear in it, this and the other pleaſure, this and the other contentment, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf: Surely, think men, if I am in ſuch a condition, I ſhall finde ſomething there; if I have this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, I ſhall finde happineſs there: but the world is not that which men take it for: when they have tried the variety of pleaſures and conditions they expected happineſs in, they do not finde that happineſs and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in them they expected. All earthly pleaſures have an emptineſs in them, and leave the ſoul under a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thirſt after the enjoyment of them then it was in before.

               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:62027:62"/>Carnal pleaſures are ſo far from quenching the thirſt of the ſoul, that they do increaſe it; and though it commonly falls out that ſenſual men are ſoon ſurfeited and cloyed with one pleaſure, yet not finding that which they expect in one pleaſure, that doth beget in them a thirſt after ſome new pleaſures. Theſe golden dreams of finding happineſs in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, makes men forget the true pleaſures, the pleaſures that are at Gods right hand. This <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> happineſs which men pleaſe themſelves with, in earthly things, takes them off from minding that which is ſolid, ſubſtantial happineſs indeed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Another impediment of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs,</hi> is <hi>want of a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the glory and eternity of the future ſtate.</hi> The reaſon why men deſire no more, and long no more, after future things, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not duely conſider the glory and eternity of future things. The Scripture tells us, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62027:63"/>things which God hath prepared for them that love him. In his preſence there is fulneſs of joy, at his right hand there are pleaſures for evermore: and they ſhall drink abundantly of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his pleaſure. The glory which thou haſt given to me, I have given to them.</hi> All theſe things, and much more, doth the Scripture ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the future ſtate. Now want of a due conſideration of theſe things, is the cauſe that men are no more heavenly-minded. Things that are not known, are not deſired, are not loved, are not longed after: Had we a due conſideration of the glory and eternity of the future ſtate, we ſhould be more affected with it. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the glory of the future ſtate, either as to the <hi>privative,</hi> or <hi>poſitive</hi> part of it, we ſhall finde it a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bleſſed ſtate indeed. 1. If we conſider it as to the <hi>privative</hi> part, to live in a ſtate without ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow, without grief or pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: to live in ſuch a ſtate, where there ſhall be no more wants, no more infirmities, no more imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: to live in ſuch a ſtate,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62027:63"/>where we ſhall be under no more temptations, where we ſhall be free from death, yea, from the fear or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of death or miſery: to live in ſuch a ſtate, where there ſhall be no more eclipſes of the Light of Gods countenance, where we ſhall be no more in danger of looſing the ſight and ſenſe of Gods love: This is a glorious ſtate, if you conſider it as to the privative part of it. But then, 2. If we conſider the poſitive part of this ſtate, to live in ſuch a ſtate, when we ſhall ſee God always; when we ſhall always love him, always delight in him; to live in ſuch a ſtate, where there ſhall be a full and perfect communication of God to the ſoul, where there ſhall be perfect reſt, perfect ſatisfaction; this is a bleſſed ſtate indeed: and then to think that there ſhall be no ceſſation, no not the leaſt interruption of this peace, this joy, this ſolace, this ſatisfaction; this muſt needs be a bleſſed and glorious ſtate indeed. Now want of the due conſideration of theſe things, is the cauſe why we are no more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded. Fools and ſlow of heart
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62027:64"/>that we are, we think there is no happineſs, no joy, no comfort, no life to be had, but what is in this world, and to be found within the confines of time: whereas, if we could get our hearts a little out of this world, and get them up into the other world; we ſhould ſee, there is the true life, there is the true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, there is the true conſolation to be found, there and there onely are theſe things to be found. What are all the pleaſures, and delights, and injoyments of this world, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what the glorified Saints injoy in the preſence of God, in the ſight of him, and in the communication of him to their ſouls? want of a deep, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn conſideration of what is to be had and injoyed in the future life and ſtate, is a great cauſe why we have our hearts no more taken up with this life and ſtate.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Laſtly, the laſt impediment of <hi>Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> that we ſhall mention, is <hi>want of a due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what is our ultimate and laſt end.</hi> We were not born to live always here on earth, neither to injoy our laſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62027:64"/>happineſs here on earth; but we were created to a bleſſed immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to live in the preſence of God and the holy Angels, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God to all eternity. Now want of a due conſideration of this, is that which makes us ſo little heavenly-minded. Every wiſe man will minde his laſt end; the acquiring and attaining of his laſt end, is his uttermoſt perfection. If man were not capable of an higher happineſs, nor deſtinated to a higher happineſs then what the brutes and ſenſitive creatures are capable of, and are deſtinated unto, then it were his intereſt to minde ſenſible things one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but mans laſt end is higher then ſo, mans laſt end is to attain the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt perfection his being is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Now man is indowed with an intellectual and an immortal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which God hath put within him; therefore mans laſt and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end is to have a happineſs ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this intellectual and immortal principle which God hath put with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Now want of a due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration what that is by which our
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62027:65"/>beings are perfected, and in which we injoy our laſt happineſs and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is one cauſe that we are no more heavenly-minded. O, do we think that there is no other happineſs then what is to be taken in from ſenſible things, and what is to be injoyed in this life? This is a thought beneath the dignity and excellencie of our own ſouls: this is to forget the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our own being, and the great end we were created for. Certainly our ultimate perfection is to injoy a bleſſed ſtate of immortality, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable ſtate of happineſs; and if we obſerve the pulſe of our own ſouls, which way they beat, and what we do naturally long for, we ſhall finde, that which we do moſt long for is immortality, and an unchangeable ſtate of happineſs: It is to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and unchangeably happy, we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſire. Now it is a vain thing to expect either of theſe in this world: whilſt we are here on earth, neither is immortality, nor an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable ſtate of happineſs to be expected: No, this is reſerved for the other world; therefore there
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62027:65"/>ſhould our thoughts and deſires lye. If we would be heavenly-minded, we ſhould ſay within our ſelves, We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect happineſs till we come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our own Country, where we muſt ſpend the days of eternity: we never expect happineſs till we come where God and Chriſt is, untill we come to ſee him, be with him, and enjoy him to eternity. This is the laſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs God hath deſtinated his elect unto: And this is the great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs our ſouls ſhould be ſuſpiring and breathing after.</p>

            <p>THere are two Obſervations that have been propounded out of theſe words. The firſt was this:</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>1</label>
               <hi>That it is the duty of Chriſtians to ſeek after, and to ſet their affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the things which are above.</hi> If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>2</label> The ſecond Obſervation was this, <hi>That Chriſtians ought to have their hearts taken off from the world, and from earthly things, and to have their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62027:66"/>hearts carried forth to an holy contempt of this world.</hi> Set your affections on things above, not on things upon the earth.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken to the main things which we intended from the former Point, we come to the ſecond:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſtians ought to have their hearts taken off from the world, and from earthly things,</hi> &amp;c. Set your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on things above, not on things on the earth.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this Doctrine, we have three things to ſpeak unto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſhew what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>earthly things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew what it is to have our hearts <hi>taken off</hi> from the world, and from <hi>earthly things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſhew what is that <hi>holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of the world that Chriſtians ſhould be aſpiring after: we ought to have our hearts taken off from the world, and to be carryed forth unto an <hi>holy contempt</hi> of this world.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What are we to underſtand by <hi>earthly things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall very briefly touch upon this: By <hi>earthly things</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62027:67"/>all things on this ſide God, all things ſhort of God and Chriſt. In the firſt verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Seek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God:</hi> And at the third verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> So that the things here on the earth ſeem to be <hi>oppoſed</hi> to God and Chriſt; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not God and Chriſt, is not to be the great and ſupreme object of our affection. By the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here upon the earth, we are to underſtand theſe <hi>lower</hi> things, created things, temporal things. Another Apoſtle explains this at large to us, what we are to underſtand by the things on the earth: 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that by things on the earth we are to underſtand temporal things, all things that are found within the compaſs of this lower world, <hi>riches, honours, earthly delights and pleaſures, long life it ſelf.</hi> Long life, though it be a bleſſing in it ſelf, yet it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we may love it inordinately, as we do other things. Now theſe are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62027:67"/>the things we ſhould not ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon, <hi>viz.</hi> all things ſhort of God and Chriſt; created things, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, we ought not ſo to ſet our hearts upon any of theſe things, ſo as to make them the great and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme object of our affections.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But the ſecond thing is that which will take us up a little more conſideration.</p>
            <p>What is it to have our hearts <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off</hi> from the world, and from <hi>earthly things?</hi> How is the Text to be underſtood, when it is ſaid, <hi>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth? Not on things on the earth.</hi> This we ſhall open two ways, <hi>Negatively</hi> and <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> by ſhewing what is not here meant, when we are bid not to <hi>ſet our affections on things on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> what is here meant, when we are commanded not to <hi>ſet our affections on things on the earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> what is not here meant, when we are bid not to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62027:68"/>
               <hi>ſet our affections on things on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negatively,</hi> we may take it in three Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The meaning is not, as if we may not <hi>think</hi> of <hi>earthly things</hi> at all: we may think of <hi>earthly things</hi> as they are the <hi>works</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> of God. The creature was given us as a glaſs to contemplate God in, and therefore we may and ought to think of theſe things, ſo as by them to riſe up to the contemplation of God: Every creature is a ſpectacle,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Creatura omnis ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaculum eſt, ut in omnibus Creatorem Artificem quaras.</hi> Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> that in it we may ſeek for the Creator, who is the former and maker of it: that is a holy and a bleſſed uſe of the creature, when by the creature we are led to the Creator; therefore that is not the meaning, when it is ſaid that it is our duty to have our hearts taken off from the world and earthly things, that we may not think of earthly things at all: We may think of them as the gifts of God, and as things to lead us unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The meaning is not, as if we may not care for theſe things in a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62027:68"/>moderate and ſubordinate way. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>He that cares not for his own is worſe then an inſidel.</hi> There is a moderate and a regular care for theſe things, which is lawful. The Scripture commands men to <hi>work with their hands the thing that is good, that they may give to him that needeth,</hi> Eph. 4.28.</p>
            <p>Therefore there is a moderate and a ſubordinate care about temporal things which is lawful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The meaning is not, that we may not <hi>uſe</hi> earthly things. When it is ſaid a Chriſtian ought to have his heart taken off from the world, the meaning is not, as if a Chriſtian may not at all intermeddle with and uſe earthly things. It is the obſervation of a Learned man upon the text:

               <hi>The Apoſtle bids us not to ſeek or to ſet our affections upon earthly things, but he doth not forbid us to uſe earthly things.</hi> The Spirit of God makes it a piece of Antichriſtian ſuperſtition, that Antichriſt commands <hi>to abſtain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanks-giving of them which believe and know the truth,</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62027:69"/>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. It is a part of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm, to forbid men to uſe the creatures of God which are lawful in themſelves. And in the ſame place he ſaith, <hi>Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with thanks-giving.</hi> It is true, we muſt onely <hi>uſe</hi> the creatures, but we muſt <hi>enjoy</hi> God: the creatures are not ſo to be uſed, as that we ſhould ſtick in them, and go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but we muſt uſe the creature to a farther end: we muſt uſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo, as by them to be led to God the chief good: yet uſe them we may in their place, and to bring us to the laſt end.</p>
            <p>So much is to be ſpoken Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what we muſt not underſtand by this, when it is ſaid a Chriſtian muſt have his heart taken off from the world and earthly things.</p>
            <p>But then Affirmatively, what is it that is here intended, when it is ſaid we muſt <hi>not ſet our affections upon things on the earth?</hi> What is it to have our affections taken off from the world, and from earthly things?</p>
            <p>I ſhall open this in four Particulars.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62027:69"/>
            <p n="1">1. Not to <hi>ſet our affections on things on the earth,</hi> it is, not to make theſe things our <hi>laſt end and ſcope.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath his laſt end, he hath ſomething that he purſues, as his laſt end; now not to <hi>ſet our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on things on the earth,</hi> it is, not to purſue theſe things as our laſt end: our laſt end ought to be above this world, to lye out of this world. <hi>I preſs toward the mark</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.14. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſomething as his end which lay beyond this world, which lay out of this world: we ought not to be content with an earthly happineſs: we ought not to think, If we can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an eſtate, live in pleaſure here on earth, provide for our ſelves and families, draw forth our lives to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, and have our days filled up with earthly comforts; that this is our laſt end, this is all we have to look after, and that we need have no higher ſcope then theſe things: A Chriſtian ought to have an end, a ſcope, and an intereſt beyond all earthly things.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:62027:70"/>
            <p n="2">2. Not to <hi>ſet our affections on earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things,</hi> it is, not to <hi>place our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and felicity</hi> in theſe things; we ſhould not take up our reſt and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in theſe things. <hi>When riches increaſe, ſet not thy heart upon them,</hi> ſaith the wiſeman, and the Spirit of God by him. That which men purſue as their laſt end, they are apt to take up their reſt and happineſs in it, when once they have acquired it: That appears from that of the rich man in the Goſpel: <hi>Soul, ſoul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry.</hi> Worldly men make the world their chief good, and acquieſce in it as their chief good. Now not to <hi>ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon the things on the earth,</hi> is, not to acquieſce in, and take up with the creature as our chief good and happineſs. A Chriſtian ought to ſay,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonorum ſumma Deus eſt, Deus eſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſummum bonum.</hi> Aug.</note> God is my portion, he is my happineſs, my felicity: God is the ſum of all good things, God is our chief good: this ſhould be the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a Chriſtian. A Chriſtian ſhould take up in nothing as his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs but in God himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:62027:70"/>
            <p n="3">3. Not to <hi>ſet our affections on things on the earth,</hi> is this, not to imploy our <hi>principal care and induſtry</hi> about theſe things. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Our <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> care ought to be about ſpiritual and eternal things: and then we do not ſet our affections on earthly things, when our firſt and principal care is not about earthly things, but about thoſe other things. To ſeek after, and to ſet a mans affections on earthly things in this place,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Toto corde deſider are.</hi> Davenant.</note> it is with all a mans heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after theſe things, with all a mans might and endeavor to ſeek after theſe things. Now in this ſenſe, we ſhould not <hi>ſet our affections on earthly things;</hi> that is, the main ſtrength of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the main ſtrength of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhould not run out to theſe things. It is an expreſſion of <hi>Auſtin,
<note place="margin">Ad Creato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem tendere jubemur, non ad crea. turam, ut efficiamur beati.</note> We are commanded to have our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie towards the Creator, not towards the creature, that we may be made happy.</hi> The command is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy ſoul, and all thy ſtrength, and all thy might.</hi> We are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62027:71"/>no where commanded to love other things ſo; we are no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to love the creature with all our heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength, and might: we may and ought to love the creature in its place, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to God; but we may not love the creature as we love God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To have a mans heart taken off from the world, it is, to be <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> dead to the world. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf that he was <hi>crucified to the world, and the world was crucified to him, Gal.</hi> 6.14. We ought to have <hi>dead</hi> affections, as it were, to the world and to earthly things, and to have <hi>living</hi> affections towards God and ſpiritual things:
<note place="margin">

                  </gap> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum amat, quod non propter te amat.</note> It is a ſweet ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin; He loves thee too little, who loves any thing together with thee, which he doth not love for thee.</hi> This
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62027:71"/>is to be ſpiritually dead to the world, when if our love to God and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be compared, our love to the creature is but poor and mean, in compariſon of that higher love we finde working in our hearts towards God himſelf. A holy ſoul ſhould be able to ſay, Lord, thou art dearer to me then heaven and earth, yea, then all things in heaven and earth: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid ſo, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, or whom have I on earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. What is that <hi>holy contempt</hi> of the world we ſhould be aſpiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For thus it is expreſs'd in the Doctrine; A Chriſtian ought to have his heart carryed forth to an <hi>holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of this world.</p>
            <p>That may be opened in a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould have <hi>low and mean thoughts of the world.</hi> The contempt of the world conſiſts in this, in having <hi>low and mean thoughts of the world:</hi> he that contemns a thing, hath low and mean thoughts of that thing: He that contemns a thing, apprehends no great worth or excellencie in it,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62027:72"/>for which he ſhould eſteem it. A Chriſtian's contempt of the world conſiſts in this; when he hath mean thoughts of the world, he ſees no ſuch great worth or excellencie in it, for which he ſhould admire it. <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted all things but <hi>loſs and dung for the excellencie of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.8. A Chriſtan that hath a true contempt of the world, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends there is little good or worth in worldly things, in compariſon of God, and Chriſt, and eternal things. It is a great expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>We look not to the things which are ſeen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. We look not to them: What then? we <hi>overlook</hi> them, we deſpiſe them, we look above them; we have ſomething greater in our eye, and therefore theſe things ſeem little to us: He that hath a greater good in his eye, overlooks a leſſer thing; a greater good ſwallows up a leſſer good. This is an <hi>holy contempt</hi> of the world, to have low and mean thoughts of the world, to look upon the world as having no excellenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in it, in compariſon of God and Chriſt, and eternal things.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62027:72"/>
            <p n="2">2. The contempt of the world we ſhould preſs after, is this: we ſhould not be too <hi>anxious</hi> and <hi>ſolicitous</hi> about earthly things: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.31. <hi>Take no thought, ſaying, What ſhall we eat? what ſhall we drink? or wherewithal ſhall we be cloathed?</hi> that is, take no anxious, no ſolicitous thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe things.
<note place="margin">Contemnere eſt rem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligere, &amp; de tâ non curare.</note> To contemn a thing, is to neglect it, and not to take care about it: that is a ſigne of our contempt of the world, when we have no anxious thoughts about it, when we are not much concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, when we have an holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie of ſpirit about it; we are thankful to God if he give us theſe things, and yet we are not too much dejected or caſt down if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe things to us. <hi>I have learned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.14.</note> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>in whatſoever eſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſpirit with a mans preſent ſtate, is a ſigne that a man is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the world: For if a man be wedded to the world, then he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and diſcontented, if he have not all he would have.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The contempt of the world, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62027:73"/>of earthly things, conſiſts in this; when a man accounts and thinks with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he may be happy without theſe things. Let us obſerve this well: the contempt of the world lyes much in this; when a man accounts and thinks with himſelf he may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py without theſe things; when a man lives under this apprehenſion, My happineſs lyes not in theſe things; if God deny me theſe things, I may be happy without them; the eſſence of happineſs lyes not in theſe things: This is a ſigne of the contempt of the world; he that hath ſuch an opinion of a thing, as that he thinks he may be happy without that thing, ſuch a man may be ſaid to have a contempt of that thing: This is the contempt of the world we ſhould labour after, ſo as to think we may be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe things. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſay of their wiſe man, <hi>He may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many things, but he wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Truely, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould be able to ſay ſo, much more; though he be without many things, yet he wants nothing, nothing that is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to true happineſs: though he be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62027:73"/>without many earthly comforts that others injoy, yet he hath God and Chriſt, and the hope of eternal things to live upon; and he may be happy in theſe things, although he want other things. When a man is fixt in his own thoughts in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of happineſs, he knows he may be happy without this world: this is a ſigne ſuch a man is crucified to the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To contemn the world, is for a man to think he is not made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by earthly things, when he hath theſe things: as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>Meat commends us not to God:</hi> If we eat, we are not the better; if we eat not, we are not the worſe. So a Chriſtian may ſay, It is not any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral thing that commends me to God: if I have much or little, it is not that which makes me accepted with God. But let us not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here. Firſt, I grant that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may ſee a vein of love in temporal things: <hi>He delivered me, becauſe he delighted in me,</hi> Pſal. 18. <hi>David</hi> ſaw <hi>ſpecial</hi> love, <hi>peculiar</hi> love, in a temporal deliverance:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62027:74"/>
               <hi>Having given us his Son,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> And <hi>ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things ſhall be added to you.</hi> When a Chriſtian ſees temporal bleſſings flowing from <hi>covenant-love;</hi> when he ſees them given in as appendices to greater mercies, ſo far he may ſee the love of God in theſe things. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Temporal things, ſo far as they conduce to a higher end, may be ſaid in a ſubordinate way to conduce to a Chriſtians happineſs. The things of this world, ſo far as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to keep a man from ſin, and to make him ſerve God the better, ſo far they are to be valued. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me: leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the Name of my God in vain.</hi> Temporal things, ſo far as they are means to keep us from ſin, and fit us for the ſervice of God; ſo far they are to be eſteemed: but that which I ſay is, that temporal things conſidered in themſelves, do not conſtitute or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62027:74"/>make up a Chriſtians happineſs. A Chriſtians true happineſs lies out of the road and chanel of theſe things; and therefore when he hath theſe things, he ought to ſay, My happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies above theſe things.
<note place="margin">Omnis mibi copia quae Deus meus non eſt, ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas eſt.</note> 
               <hi>All that abundance of mine which is none of my God, is but my penury and want,</hi> ſays <hi>Auſtin.</hi> All earthly things, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with God and Chriſt, are none of a Chriſtians happineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The contempt of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this; and I take it, that much of the ſpirit of the contempt of the world (if I may ſo expreſs it) lies in this: When a mans heart is carryed off from the world, becauſe his heart is reſerved for higher things. <hi>We look not to the things which are ſeen, but to the things which are not ſeen. Paul</hi>'s heart was taken off from preſent things, becauſe his heart was referved for, and taken up with higher things: <hi>Our converſation is in heaven,</hi> Phil. 3.20. He had ſpoken of ſome before, that <hi>minded earthly things;</hi> now he ſaith, <hi>Our converſation is in heaven.</hi> The reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> had his heart taken off from earthly things, was,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62027:75"/>becauſe <hi>his converſation was in heaven;</hi> he expected other things. A Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhould have his heart rapt up with the contemplation and admiration of eternal things. A Chriſtian ſhould cry out as <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth:
<note place="margin">O amare, O ire, O ſibi perire, O ad Deum pervenire.</note> 
               <hi>O to love God, O to go to him, O to die and periſh to a mans ſelf, O to come to God!</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould ſolace and delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the thoughts of the Divine preſence, and account all things here on earth little in compariſon of that preſence. It is an expreſſion which <hi>Luther</hi> hath:
<note place="margin">Debemus magno ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnere mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, &amp; pleno pectore anbelare ad gloriam fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae vitae.</note> 
               <hi>We ought with a great ſoul to contemn this world, and with a full gale of affection to breathe after the glory of the future life.</hi> This is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contempt of the world, when the thoughts, apprehenſions, deſires, and expectation of future things cauſeth us to reſerve our affections mainly and principally for theſe things; when we look upon theſe as thoſe things which mainly and principally deſerve our love. A Chriſtian ſhould keep his heart reſerved for God, and ſay, Lord, I would not love any thing that may not conſiſt with my love to thee; I would not enjoy any thing that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62027:75"/>may not conſiſt with my communion with thee. A Chriſtian ſhould be able to turn his eye upon God, &amp; ſay, Here is my riches, here is my true ſweetneſs, my ſolace, my delight,
<note place="margin">Dominus Deus meus, vita mea, dulcedo mea ſancta.</note> my great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and felicity. <hi>The Lord my God he is my life, my holy ſweetneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> This is another diſcovery of our contempt of the world, when a man hath his heart carried off from theſe things upon this account, that his heart is reſerved for higher things, and that other things have taken up his heart.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The contempt of the world conſiſts in this: When our hearts ſit looſe from the world, and we are at a parting point with theſe things: <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you that forſakes not all that he hath, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my diſciple:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> doth not <hi>bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> to all things, is not ready to take his leave of all things. God doth not always call us to an actual forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all things; but we muſt be in an habitual readineſs to forſake all things when he calls us ſo to do. Our hearts muſt not be ſo riveted and glued to earthly things, but we muſt be in a readineſs to part with them,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62027:76"/>and quit our intereſt in them, when God calls us ſo to do. When a man holds faſt his eſtate and comforts, when it is clear God calls him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go them, it is a ſigne ſuch a man hath little contempt of the world in him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We ought to contemn the world ſo, as not to envie others for their worldly proſperity. When a man thinks that others are happie, and that he is not happie, becauſe he enjoys not what they do; this is a certain ſigne ſuch a man hath too great and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts of the world and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. A man that hath an holy contempt of earthly things, knows that men are not made happie by theſe things; and therefore if God hath given him higher and better things, Himſelf, his Son, his Spirit, his grace, pardon of ſin, and the hopes of eternal things; he is not troubled to ſee God heaping temporal things upon ſuch to whom he denies theſe things. Therefore this is another thing wherein the contempt of the world doth conſiſt, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the world ſo, as not to envie others for their worldly proſperity.</p>
            <pb n="143" facs="tcp:62027:76"/>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Doctrine, why we ought to have our hearts taken off from the <hi>world,</hi> and from <hi>earthly things.</hi>
            </p>

Earthly things are rather good in <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>appearance,</hi> then have any thing of <hi>ſolid good</hi> in them. The good that is in earthly things is more in appearance then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. And as the world makes a greater ſhew of good then indeed is to be found in it: ſo what good there is in it, it is ſo thin and mean, that it is not that which men take it for. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches take themſelves wings, and flee away.</hi> Some obſerve, that here are two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to condemn the ſin of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs:</hi> the one is taken from the <hi>vanity</hi> of riches, the other from the <hi>inſtability</hi> of them. It is the firſt of theſe that I am ſpeaking of: <hi>Wilt thou ſet thy beart upon that which is not?</hi> Riches are <hi>not</hi> what they ſeem to be: there is not ſo much good in them as men take to be in them. External
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62027:77"/>things have little of <hi>ſolid worth</hi> or <hi>excellencie</hi> in them. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſaith of her ſelf, that ſhe will <hi>cauſe them that love her to inherit ſubſtance:</hi> Prov. 8.21. In the Original it is <hi>[that which is]</hi> that which hath <hi>eſſence, ſubſtance, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</hi> So the meaning is, Thoſe that love wiſdom ſhall inherit <hi>ſubſtantial riches,</hi> ſuch riches as have <hi>real worth</hi> in them: Chriſt, grace, and ſpiritual things, they are real, ſolid, ſubſtantial goods; there is ſubſtance, ſolidity in theſe things. But now, external things they <hi>are not;</hi> that is, there is none of that ſubſtantial ſolid worth in them. Not but that the creatures of God are good in their kinde, and for the uſes for which God hath appointed them: the Lord made all things, and behold they were <hi>good, very good.</hi> But when we ſay there is little good in theſe things, the meaning is, there is little good in them in compariſon of ſpiritual and eternal things.

            <p n="3">3. What are the Evils of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhall propound ſome few brief Remedies againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> is. <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an inordinate and inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62027:84"/>after earthly things.</hi> Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a large ſence reſpects all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things. When a man is inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and immoderate in his deſires or appetite after any earthly thing, this is Covetouſneſs in a large ſenſe. But in a ſtrict and proper ſence, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is converſant <hi>circa bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num utile,</hi> about profitable good, or the good of profit. When a man hath an inordinate appetite after <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Money, Lands, Poſſeſſions,</hi> an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate;</hi> this is <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> in a ſtrict and proper ſence. Now that which makes this deſire unlawful, and brings it under the <hi>denomination</hi> of a ſin, is when there is an <hi>inordinate</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate</hi> deſire of theſe things. Every deſire of temporal things is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, neither comes it under this denomination; but it is, Firſt, the <hi>inordinate</hi> deſire; Secondly, The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable</hi> deſire after theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the deſire of them is inordinate, and not referred to a right end. It is the obſervation of a Learned man:
<note place="margin">Davenant.</note> Temporal things may be deſired three manner of ways: 1. For the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of life. 2. Or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62027:85"/>elſe that by them we may perform works of <hi>bounty</hi> or <hi>liberality.</hi> 3. Or elſe for <hi>fruitions</hi> ſake: ſo to deſire theſe things, as to make them our <hi>end,</hi> and to take up our <hi>reſt</hi> in them. It is the laſt of theſe that conſtitutes and makes the ſin of <hi>Covetouſneſs.</hi> We may deſire earthly things ſo far as they conduce to the neceſſities of this life, and ſo far as we may have opportunity to do good with them: but to deſire them ſo as to make them our laſt end, and to enjoy them as our happineſs, this is that which makes Covetouſneſs. This is a ſure Rule: No temporal thing is to be deſired for it ſelf, but in order to a farther end. We muſt <hi>enjoy</hi> God, and <hi>uſe</hi> the creature: we muſt <hi>enjoy</hi> God, onely <hi>uſe</hi> the creature in order to our enjoyment of God. Now when we ſtick in the creature as our laſt end, this is ſinful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As in Covetouſneſs there is an <hi>inordinate</hi> deſire of earthly things; ſo there is in Covetouſneſs an <hi>inſatiable</hi> deſire of earthly things. Much of the formality of this ſin lies in this. A covetous minde is never ſatisfied:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62027:85"/>
               <hi>He that loves ſilver ſhall not be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſilver;</hi> this is the proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Greek word: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> properly ſignifies an unſatiable deſire of having more: when a man hath never ſo much, he ſtill deſireth more. Like a man that is ſick of the Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſie, the more he drinks, the more he thirſts: this is the covetous man. It is the nature of earthly things, that they cannot <hi>reſtinguere ſuim animae,</hi> they cannot ſtanch the thirſt of the ſoul: therefore the more a man hath of them, (if Covetouſneſs be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in him) the more he thirſteth after them.</p>
            <p>We come now to the ſecond thing, and that is to ſhew what are the <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Symptoms</hi> of this Sin. Covetouſneſs is a ſpiritual ſin, and therefore cannot be ſo well detected as ſome other ſins may be: it is true, the objects of covetouſneſs are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, as <hi>money, riches, lands, poſſeſſions,</hi> and theſe things are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but foraſmuch as theſe things may be deſired and uſed lawfully or unlawfully, according as the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or affection of the minde is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62027:86"/>verſant about them; therefore it is more difficult for us to ſay that ſuch a man lyes under the predominancie of that ſin: But though it may be more difficult for us to faſten the guilt of this ſin upon another, yet every mans conſcience may be judge, how far this evil root prevails in himſelf. Now the Signes and Symptoms of this Sin, are ſuch as theſe.</p>

The Apoſtle ſaith of ſome, that they <hi>minde earthly things, Phil.</hi> 3.19. that is, they do ſolely and wholly minde them, they think of nothing elſe: When a man thinks of nothing elſe from one end of the week to another but temporal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this is a ſigne of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancie of this ſin. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Where a mans treaſure is, there will his heart be.</hi> If a mans heart lye in the world, if his thoughts and affections lye in it, it is a ſigne the world is his treaſure, the world is his chief good.

If a man do not electively, and upon choice, let out his thoughts upon earthly things, he is glad when he is freed from the <hi>cumber</hi> of the world; he is glad when he hath an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be freed from his neceſſary engagements, to attend on holy things: Whereas, a man that mindes earthly things out of a <hi>covetous bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> the natural bent of his minde carries him to theſe things; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on choice he deſires to converſe with theſe things, rather then with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and divine things.</p>

When a man makes the world his <hi>greateſt intereſt;</hi> that is, when a man is more ſolicitous to ſecure the world, then to ſecure heaven: When a man is more afraid of temporal wants, temporal ſtreights, then he is, that he ſhall miſs <hi>ſalvation.</hi> It was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62027:87"/>the counſel that our Saviour gave, <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth.</hi>

So much as godlineſs prevails, ſo far it makes a man content with his preſent eſtate; ſo far as covetouſneſs prevails, it makes him diſcontent. When a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is quarrelling with the providence of God, and thinks God doth not deal well with him, becauſe he is not ſo as he would be, hath not ſuch accommodations as he would have, and it may be others have: It is a ſigne this evil humour prevails too much in him.</p>

Another ſigne of covetouſneſs is this: when a man is of a <hi>tenacious ſpirit;</hi> when a man will be ſure to hold faſt all that he hath, and will part with nothing. Covetouſneſs is an inordinate deſire, both of <hi>getting</hi> and of <hi>keeping</hi> earthly things: as cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62027:89"/>diſcovers it ſelf one way, when men have an inordinate deſire of getting what they have not; ſo covetouſneſs diſcovers it ſelf ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, when their hearts are clung to what they have gotten; when they have an inordinate deſire of keeping what they have. It is a Precept which our Saviour gives, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.33. <hi>Sell that which you have, and give alms.</hi> This is a hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and few can bear it: It is true, this Precept ought to be underſtood aright, it is not binding at all times; for this is a Rule in Divinity,

               <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts, though they are binding, yet not at all times:</hi> But this Precept, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Sell that which ye have, and give alms,</hi> is ſo far bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a man ſhould be ready to part with his eſtate, when God calls him to it: when it may make much for the glory of God, and the advantage of the Goſpel; when a man hath a clear call to part with his eſtate, a man ought to be ready ſo to do.

            <p n="3">3. I come to ſhew in the next place the evils of this ſin: there is more of this ſin in us then we are aware of, and more evil in it then we are aware of: Let us conſider well the evil of this ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Covetouſneſs is idolatry. This is twice mentioned in the Scripture: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. <hi>This know, that no covetous man, who is an idolater, hath an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the kingdom of God and Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Mortifie your earthly members.</hi> What are they? <hi>fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, evil concupiſence, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is idolatry.</hi> It is not for nothing that this is twice mentioned; a covetous man is called an <hi>idolater,</hi> and covetouſneſs is called <hi>idolatry.</hi> The Spirit of God would put a brand
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62027:91"/>upon this ſin, the <hi>blackeſt</hi> brand; and what is the brand the Spirit of God would put upon the ſin of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? he calls it <hi>idolatry.</hi> Oh let us take heed how we love that ſin which God deſignes to render moſt odious and abominable. There are ſeveral reaſons given by Learned men, why covetouſneſs is called Idolatry. 1. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively,</hi> Covetouſneſs is not called Idolatry, in reſpect of a covetous mans intention, as if he intended to make his money his God; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>likeneſs</hi> and <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a covetous man ſhews that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his money, as an idolater doth to his idol. 2. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is called idolatry: 1. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe idolatry is one of the worſt of ſins. 2. Becauſe a covetous perſon ſets up his wealth and riches in the place of God. A covetous man <hi>loves</hi> his wealth more then God; he <hi>truſts</hi> in his riches more then in God, and he <hi>ſerves</hi> his riches, and is more ſolicitous about them, then he is ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticious to ſerve and pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A covetous man loves theſe outward things more then he loves
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62027:91"/>God: that is a mans God, which hath moſt of his heart. The great Commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi> When a man loves any thing more then God, that is his god: Therefore it is well ſaid of one of the Ancients, that a covetous man is guilty of idolatry,

            <p n="2">2. A covetous man truſts in his riches: It is proper to God onely to be the object of our truſt.

               <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt loathes a man that is a lover of the world.</hi> God is curious of nothing ſo much as of his peoples affections. <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart,</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</hi> When thoſe affections which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62027:93"/>ſhould be reſerved for God, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for other things, God loathes and abominates ſuch a man: <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abode with him, Joh.</hi> 14.23. God promiſes, if a man love him, he will make his abode with him: covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſuch a ſin as is inconſiſtent with our love to God; therefore where the love of God is not, God will never make his abode with ſuch a ſoul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Covetouſneſs is ſuch a ſin as is moſt directly contrary to the <hi>nature</hi> of grace, and the work of the <hi>new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the ſoul: the reaſon is, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of grace is to carry out the ſoul to ſpiritual things, and to cauſe it to deſire ſpiritual things; grace cauſeth the ſoul to minde a ſpiritual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to look after a ſpiritual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: grace makes a man ſee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie in the pardon of ſin, in the favour of God, in the image of God, and in conformity to God. On the contrary, covetouſneſs cauſeth a man to place his happineſs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62027:93"/>things; a covetous perſon placeth his happineſs in thoſe things which are <hi>bona corporis,</hi> the good things of the body: he regards not grace and ſpiritual things, which are <hi>bona animi,</hi> the good things of the minde. Hence it is that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ranks covetouſneſs amongſt the worſt of ſins; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor eſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> Here we ſee covetouſneſs is rankt with the worſt of ſins: covetouſneſs is as directly contrary to the nature of grace, as a groſs ſin, and in ſome reſpect more; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is poſſible a man by ſurprize, and upon a ſudden temptation, may be overtaken with a groſs ſin, when yet the <hi>bent</hi> of his ſoul hath been ſet againſt it: but covetouſneſs conſiſts in this, when the <hi>bent</hi> of a mans affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions lyes towards earthly things; and therefore nothing is more directly contrary to the nature of Grace then
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62027:94"/>this ſin; and it becomes us to look to this, becauſe it is ſo inconſiſtent with the nature of Grace: The thorny ground fell ſhort of a true work of Grace, upon this account, becauſe the <hi>cares of the world, and the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of riches did choke the world.</hi> Many a mans profeſſion comes to nought, and never riſes up to true grace, becauſe the love of the world is predominant in him: though he may go far, and have ſome ſeeming good affections, yet all comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe the world hath the predominancie in his heart. How much doth it concern us to look well to it, to ſee that we do not looſe all our profeſſion upon this accompt, that the world hath had more of our hearts then God and Chriſt have had?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Covetouſneſs is ſuch a ſin as is moſt contrary to our <hi>future</hi> life: hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God ſhall be <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all.</hi> hereafter we ſhall live upon God immediately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other things. In heaven, as we ſhall have no other happineſs but God, ſo we ſhall deſire no other happineſs but God himſelf. If it were poſſible that the Saints and Angels could deſire
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62027:94"/>any thing which they have not, they could not be happy; for this is the nature of happineſs, to have all the good a man would have. The Saints and Angels in heaven have God for their happineſs, and they are ſatisfied in him, and deſire nothing more. Now when the heart is carried out after other things, and purſues them as the chief good: this is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our future life. It was the ſpeech of a wiſe and holy man: <hi>Since God ſhall be all in all hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the leſs we have to do with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here any more then we needs muſt, the better.</hi> If we were of a right temper of ſpirit, we ſhould deſire earthly things no farther then were for preſent neceſſity, and as they were accommodated to our preſent ſtate. True happineſs lyes out of the road of theſe things; true happineſs is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chanel; true happineſs is to ſee God, to love God, to injoy God: <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the onely true God.</hi> When we purſue earthly things as our great happineſs, and have vaſt deſignes after theſe things; this is moſt contrary to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62027:95"/>life, which is to injoy God, and him onely.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Covetouſneſs is the <hi>root</hi> of many other ſins. The Scripture tells us expreſly, That covetouſneſs <hi>is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.10. A cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſon ſticks at no ſin; ſo he may inrich himſelf, and compaſs his own ends, he will omit the duties God requires, and commit the ſins God forbids. God enjoyns ſecret Prayer, Family-duties, and attendance upon the Ordinances; a covetous perſon is ſo intent upon the world, that he cannot finde time for theſe things: So for ſins of commiſſion, a covetous perſon will break through many a known command of God, to come at the world. Covetouſneſs is a fruitful ſin; a covetous perſon ſins againſt his Neighbour, againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and againſt God. 1. A covetous man ſins againſt his Neighbour; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts from another more then is juſt and equal, and ſo covetouſneſs is a ſin that is contrary to equity:
<note place="margin">Avaritia excedit in acci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Covetouſneſs exceeds in taking, and is defective in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> &amp; ſo is a ſin againſt <hi>equity.</hi> 2. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is a ſin againſt mans ſelf; by
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62027:95"/>this ſin a mans affections are diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and turned out of the right chanel: Our affections were given us to love God the chief good; by this ſin they are turned aſide to inferiour goods. And hence is it that <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls that a <hi>perverſe love,</hi> whereby the will is turned aſide from an unchangeable good, to a mutable changeable good. 3. It is a ſin againſt God; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a covetous perſon for a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good contemns an eternal good. All theſe conſiderations may ſerve to ſet forth ſomething of the evil of this ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I come in the laſt place to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome Remedies againſt this ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As an Antidote againſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Let us conſider, we muſt ſhortly leave theſe things: that is not worth ſetting a mans heart upon, which he muſt ſhortly leave. We know what our Saviour ſaith,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.20.</note> 
               <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall they take thy ſoul from thee, and then whoſe ſhall theſe things be?</hi> What folly is it to make that our happineſs, which we cannot keep always? that is true happineſs, which a man may enjoy always; and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62027:96"/>it is a <hi>pityful</hi> happineſs that muſt have an end. Why ſhould we covet that much, which when we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, we can keep but a little while! It is an expreſſion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>The world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof:
<note place="margin">Quod vis? utrum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralia, &amp; tranſire cum tempore; ant mundum non amare, &amp; vivere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cum Deo?</note> What wilt thou? wilt thou love temporal things, and paſs away with time? or elſe wilt thou not love the world, and live with God?</hi> It might be one good remedy againſt covetouſneſs, to meditate of death of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. It is <hi>Auſtins</hi> obſervation, The diſeaſe of covetouſneſs is by nothing better cured, then when the day of death is continually thought of: if a man could think this with himſelf, I muſt ſhortly dye and leave theſe things, this would moderate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to theſe things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, a mans life lyes not in theſe things, whilſt he hath them: So our Saviour teacheth us expreſly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Take heed and beware of covetouſneſs: for a mans life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> Our life lyes not in theſe things; and there are two reaſons of it: 1. Becauſe the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62027:96"/>of outward things cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a mans life: the rich dye as well as the poor, the noble as well as the ignoble. <hi>Pale death with an equal foot knocks at the palaces of princes, and at the cottages of poor men.</hi> 2. Becauſe true happineſs doth not lye in theſe things whilſt a man injoys them: every creature hath vanity written upon it; and when a man hath moſt of the world, he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unſatisfied. No earthly thing is ſuitable to the nature and capacity of the ſoul: The ſoul is a ſpiritual thing, and deſires a ſpiritual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the ſoul is an immortal thing, and deſires an immortal happineſs; and therefore when a man hath moſt of this world, he ſtill deſires ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, a little will ſerve the turn to carry us to our journeys end. It is not likely we ſhould live longer then the reſt of mankinde have lived before us; it is no difficult thing to ſee to the end of our life: now a little proviſion will ſerve the turn for a ſhort journey.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhall have no need of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62027:97"/>earthly things in the other ſtate. It is certain we brought nothing into this world, and we ſhall carry nothing out of it: We ſhall carry nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next world with us, but our grace: earthly things will be of no uſe to us at the end of time. Our happineſs in the next world is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual happineſs: the holy Angels and glorified Saints are happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe things we ſo much admire; and we muſt be happy by another happineſs at laſt, if ever we be happy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we would be kept from this ſin,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Avarus ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis eſt cui Deus non ſufficit.</hi> Aug.</note> let us ſtudy <hi>Gods all-ſufficiencie</hi> and the <hi>divine perfection. He is too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous a perſon indeed, to whom God himſelf is not ſufficient.</hi> God is a happineſs ſufficient for himſelf; he is an happineſs ſufficient to the Saints and Angels, and therefore in reaſon he ſhould be a happineſs ſufficient for us. God is the <hi>chief good,</hi> the <hi>centre</hi> of all perfection.
<note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> 
               <hi>What is it that thou loveſt, that thou wilt not love God?</hi> If thou wilt love any thing, love the beſt thing; if thou wilt covet any thing, covet the beſt thing: ſtudy <hi>Gods all-ſufficiencie</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:62027:97"/>and the <hi>divine perfection,</hi> there thou wilt finde the higheſt object for thy affections.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let our deſires run out much after <hi>eternal</hi> life. It is an expreſſion of <hi>Auſtin: We ought,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be covetous after eternal life.</hi> The more our deſires run out in one chanel, the leſs will they run out in another. Did we covet to live with God more, to be admitted into the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to live in that ſtate in which the Saints and Angels live, we ſhould covet other things leſs: this is the truely noble covetouſneſs; we cannot covet this too much, to live with God in his eternity. Oh let us love eternal life: If we have right thoughts of the future life and the future ſtate, we ſhall ſee nothing worth deſiring and coveting in compariſon of that ſtate.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let us pray for a holy conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſpirit with our preſent ſtate. This is the Directiou which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle inſinuates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with the things which you have.</hi> Contentation with our
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62027:98"/>preſent ſtate, would prevent cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs; the reaſon why our deſires are immoderate, is becauſe we are not content with <hi>Gods allewance. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence is never overſeen,
<note place="margin">Divina providentia not poteſt falli.</note> never miſtaken.</hi> Divine Wiſdom meaſures out to every man what is beſt; and if we could think ſo, that would keep our deſires from being too violent and impetuous after theſe things.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let us ſet before us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; he is the higheſt Pattern of holineſs in every kinde. Chriſt, when he was in the world, he was Lord of all, yet he poſſeſſed little; and as he poſſeſſed little of the world, ſo he did not covet and ſeek after the things of the world. His heart was wholly taken up in glorifying the Father, and in finiſhing the work which he had given him to do: he minded not gold or ſilver, lands or poſſeſſions; his heart was ſet upon other things. True it is, that having taken to himſelf, not onely our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo the infirmities of it; he uſed the things of the world in his paſſage, as things accommodate unto
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62027:98"/>that ſtate of Humiliation, unto which he had voluntarily ſubjected himſelf: yet a little ſufficed him of theſe things that were neceſſary for the ſupport of nature; ſo far was he from deſigning to heap up wealth and riches, and from ſeeking great things for himſelf in the world.</p>

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vae tibi ſi amaveris condita, &amp; deſerueris Creatorem: pulcra tibi ſunt, ſed quanto pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crior eſt qui iſta for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavit?</hi> Aug.</note> if ſo clear and expreſs a Prohibition <hi>(Love not the word)</hi> do not bear ſway with us, what ſhould? <hi>Wo to thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, if thou love created things, and forſake the Creator: theſe things ſeem beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto thee, but how much more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful is he that made theſe things?</hi> We are all of us too prone to fall into
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62027:99"/>the love of the world, and of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. When firſt we left God in our Apoſtacie in <hi>Adam,</hi> we fell from God into the creature, and there we have ſtuck ever ſince; and it muſt be the mighty power of divine. Grace to recover us out of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to bring us back to God: the love of the world is the great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to moſt of us. I often think of the laſt counſel which an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man gave a little before his death: as he was drawing on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his diſſolution, he called his Relations to him, and gave them this as his laſt advice: <hi>Make ſure of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and take heed of the world; I have found that my greateſt enemy:</hi> If the world be our greateſt enemy, we have need to watch ſo much the more againſt it. That which we ſhall do more in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Uſe, is to propound ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conſiderations to take us off from the love of the world and earthly things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider, the love of the world, and of earthly things, is a great wrong and injury done to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62027:99"/>God.
<note place="margin">Aug.</note> 
               <hi>He that loves the creatures more then God, offends the Creator.</hi> We cannot love the world too much, but we muſt of neceſſity love God too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters.</hi> So much as our love is let forth inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately upon the creature, it muſt of neceſſity be withdrawn from God. Now this is the higheſt Sacriledge and Injuſtice: Sacriledge, to rob God of that which is his due; Injuſtice, to give that to the creature which is not due to it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider, the <hi>Soul</hi> was made for <hi>greater things:</hi> the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>immortal</hi> and an <hi>eternal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> was made to converſe with <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things,</hi> and to ſeek for happineſs in eternal things. Therefore when we love temporal things, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them as our happineſs, we forget the true nobleneſs and dignity of our own ſouls. That which doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh us from the Brutes, is an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual principle, whereby we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of contemplating and purſuing ſomething that is eternal: the Brutes minde preſent things. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Sence, to minde ſomething
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62027:100"/>preſent, and to go no further. When we onely minde and purſue preſent things, we depreſs our ſelves beneath our own <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and bring our ſelves; as it were into the rank of <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider, there are <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things</hi> for us to love; there is a greater and fairer happineſs that lies before us: we have God and Chriſt to love: there are eternal things that lie before us.
<note place="margin">

               <hi>Nothing ſatisfieth the ſoul, but the true and certain eternity of that joy which is not corruptible.</hi> Who would fix his eyes upon a <hi>Glow-worm,</hi> that hath the <hi>Sun</hi> to look upon? <hi>I have loved thee to late</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>O thou that art ſo ancient a beauty, and ſo new and freſh a beauty, I have loved thee too late.</hi> We have the <hi>living</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> God to love, and yet we love <hi>dying</hi> things. Well may we wonder at our ſelves, that having the infinite and eternal God, whom we might make the object of our affections, we ſhould take up with things ſo far ſhort of him. What are a few <hi>drops</hi> compared to the <hi>Ocean?</hi> what are a few <hi>weak rays</hi> in compariſon of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62027:100"/>
               <hi>Sun?</hi> what are all the <hi>creatures</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>Creator?</hi> God is an <hi>infinite Sea</hi> of perfection: there are no bounds nor limits to his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. In God there is all good that is <hi>deſirable,</hi> all perfection <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,</hi> all perfection <hi>poſſible.</hi> Do we deſire life? he is the fountain of life. Do we deſire wiſdom? he is the fountain of wiſdom. Do we deſire holineſs? he is the fountain of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Neither is there any thing we can conceive to be truely excellent and good, but it is in him: yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever perfection is <hi>poſſible</hi> to be, it is in God.

                  <hi>Deus est bonum infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiſſime infinitum.</hi> Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</note> 
               <hi>God is ſuch a good as is moſt inſinitely infinite.</hi> O! what folly is it then to have our hearts taken off from the infinitely-bleſſed God, and to have them ſet upon little narrow things? It is an expreſſion that one of the Ancients hath to this purpoſe: <hi>The Angels are ſo inflamed with divine love, that all other things, yea they themſelves ſeem vile to themſelves, in reſpect of God whom they love.</hi> Did we know God more, we ſhould not be ſo fond of other things. Oh! let us turn our ſouls upon God the chief
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62027:101"/>good; there may we love freely, and cannot exceed in loving him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conſider, the world and earthly things cannot give <hi>happineſs</hi> unto men. That is <hi>wiſe</hi> love, when a man loves that which will make him happie. Earthly things cannot do this. You may ſay, How doth that appear? That is eaſily made out in few words. Earthly things cannot give a man ſatisfaction while he hath them; they cannot keep him from death; they cannot comfort him in death; and leaſt of all can they be a happineſs to him after death. Now who would love that which will not anſwer the end for which he loves it? The reaſon why men love earthly things (although they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it) it is, becauſe they think to finde happineſs in them: but now that happineſs that men think to finde, is far from them. No tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing will afford that to a man, which he deſires and expects from it. Men expect ſatisfaction from what they do purſue, but ſatisfaction is far from them. Why ſhould a man be fond of that, which when he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62027:101"/>hath it, his happineſs muſt be in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above it; and when he wants it, it is poſſible for him to be happie without it. If we had all the things in this world we could deſire, if we are the children of God, and have indeed <hi>taſted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> there is ſomething above thoſe things that we ſhall ſtill deſire. Now if when we have the greateſt abundance and confluence of earthly things, there is ſomething elſe that we deſire, and ſomething elſe that muſt make us happie in the midſt of theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſence of God, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him; and that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to be happie in thoſe things, without earthly things; then there is no reaſon why our hearts ſhould be ſo inordinately ſet upon theſe earthly things.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, conſider, the inordinate love of earthly things is a <hi>perverting</hi> of the End for which God gives us theſe things. God never gave us the creatures, that we might make them our happineſs, or purſue them as our laſt end; but God gives us the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we might ſee himſelf in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62027:102"/>them, admire him in them, and paſs from them to him. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin: The creature is to be praiſed for the ſake of God the author and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it; not to be worſhipped and adored, as if it ſelf were God. All things are of him, and by him, and to him,</hi> Rom. 11.36. All things are from God, and they ought to lead to him: therefore when we love the creatures as our chief good, and ſtick in them as our laſt happineſs, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the end for which they were given to us: the creatures were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given for ſuch an end, but they were given for this end, that we might aſcend to God by them. We ought to <hi>uſe</hi> the creatures, not to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> them. Now, then do we <hi>uſe</hi> a thing, when we uſe it to a farther end: we ought to uſe the creatures in order to our enjoyment of God as our laſt end; but we ought not to take up with them, as if we had no higher end then to enjoy them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, conſider, the inordinate love of earthly things is an argument of great <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>unbelief.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man would deſire and love the beſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62027:102"/>thing: did he certainly know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there are better things then theſe that are preſent to Sence, he would love thoſe things. <hi>We look not to the things that are ſeen,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> knew that there were better things then thoſe things that are ſeen, and that theſe things were real and ſubſtantial; and therefore his heart was carried out after theſe things. Now becauſe the generality of men do not ſee theſe things, nor are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, therefore they deſire them not. The world lies before men, as a fair and pleaſant garden, and there is many a goodly flower to be ſeen in it; here is pleaſure, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, there is honour; theſe captivate the eyes of men; and becauſe things inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the outward ſences are not ſeen or perceived by them, therefore they minde not theſe things. But <hi>O ye ſons of men, how long will ye turn the glory of God into ſhame? how long will ye love vanity, and ſeek after leaſing? Pſal.</hi> 4.2. What folly and ignorance is it, to think that there are no higher things then thoſe which the Brutes are capable of converſing with as well as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62027:103"/>you? The Brutes may have their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes delighted as well as you; they may be taken and affected with preſent viſible things as well as you: but where are your ſouls in the mean time? where is your intellectual part? Can Reaſon diſcover nothing to you but what is preſent, and obvious to Sence? why then is <hi>the candle of the Lord</hi> ſet up within you? What ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs and ſtupidity is it, to believe that there is no happineſs to be found, but what is to be found in this world? As if the life which God lives, were no happineſs; as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventhly, conſider, the inordinate love of the world, and of earthly things, doth greatly unfit a man for death. Die we muſt, that is certain and the time of our life here is moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now there is nothing that will more unfit a man for death, then the inordinate love of earthly things. If a mans heart lie in the world, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth will he be to part with the world? No man is willing to part with that which he loves much. When a man that is a lover of the world comes to die, his heart is as it were rent from him: his heart lies in the world, and yet he muſt be rent from that which he loves ſo much. An <hi>holy ſoul,</hi> an <hi>heavenly-minded man,</hi> hath ſent his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand into heaven; and it is no difficult thing for him to be willing that his <hi>perſon</hi> ſhould be removed there where his <hi>affections</hi> are gone before: but now an earthly-minded man, when his perſon comes to be removed out of the world, he leaves
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62027:104"/>his heart, as it were, behinde him; and it muſt needs be very grievous and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him to part with the world, that hath ſeen nothing better then the world.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, to take us off from the love of earthly things, <hi>conſider,</hi> that all theſe things muſt have an end. <hi>The earth alſo, &amp; the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. Should a man ſet his heart upon that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little while muſt be conſumed to aſhes? If a man would love <hi>wiſely,</hi> he ſhould love that which he might always love. Nothing but eternal things laſt always; and therefore the trueſt wiſdom is to love theſe things. It is eaſie for a man to think himſelf out of all the happineſs of this world. A man may think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beyond the happineſs that is in riches, honours, or pleaſures; a man may eaſily come in his thoughts to the end of the happineſs that is in theſe things. Now ſhould a man make that his happineſs which he can think beyond? there is a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that a man cannot think himſelf out of, nor think beyond it; this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62027:104"/>happineſs is our God, who is infinite and eternal; this is ſuch a happineſs that we can never come to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of. Oh! it is good to love him as our happineſs: if we love the world as our happineſs, we and our happineſs are like to paſs away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When the Apoſtle admoniſheth us, <hi>Love not the world;</hi> what is the argument he urgeth? <hi>The world paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and the luſt thereof.</hi> The world is a <hi>tranſient</hi> thing; and as the world paſſeth away, ſo the luſts thereof paſs away: when thoſe things are gone which men had made the object of their love and affections, they have nothing left to ſet their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon. When this world comes to be burnt up, and the works thereof, none of thoſe objects are to be ſeen or injoyed, which now at the preſent draw mens hearts ſo much to them; Nay, (not to go ſo far) when men muſt enter with their naked ſouls into eternity, and muſt leave all theſe things behinde them; what will they have to love then? how ſtript, and naked, and forlorn, may we well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>carnal</hi> ſoul, who was onely
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62027:105"/>filled and fraught with <hi>creature</hi>-loves, and the love of earthly things, to be, when he comes to leave theſe things behinde him! All the objects of his affections are left behinde him; he hath none of thoſe things left him which once he let out his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What a pitiful empty thing is a miſerable ſoul, that is ſeparated from the Divine preſence? while he lived here on earth, he made a ſhift to love the creatures, and to ſuck out as much contentment from them as he could; but now he is in Eternity, he hath none of theſe things to love: And now it is a great aggravation of his miſery, to remember that he loved theſe things that did deceive him.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, The inordinate love of earthly things is a ſigne that a man is of an <hi>earthly carnal</hi> ſpirit, and that <hi>his name ſhall be written in the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The love of earthly things is a ſigne that a man is of an <hi>earthly</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:

               <hi>Every man is as his love is; if he loves the earth, he himſelf ſhall be earth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Every man is moulded into the nature of what he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62027:105"/>loves; if he loves the earth, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is turned into a piece of earth. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, <hi>That the two ſorts or kindes of love that are in the world, have conſtituted two kindes of Cities; the heavenly City, and the earthly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> If a man be a lover of heaven and the things above, he is a Citizen of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> if he be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the earth, he is a Citizen of this world: therefore let a man put the queſtion to himſelf, and ask him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what it is that he loves, and he may know what Citizen he is. The predominant love of the world, and of earthly things, is a ſigne that a man is a <hi>worldly</hi> man, a man of <hi>this world,</hi> and that he belongs to it, and that he hath nothing to do with the heavenly City, and the ſpiritual corporation that is above.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The love of earthly things is a ſigne that a man ſhall be <hi>written in the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It is a great expreſſion of the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.13. <hi>O Lord, the hope of Iſrael all that forſake thee ſhall be confounded; they that depart from thee, ſhall be written in the earth, &amp;c.</hi> When do men forſake God?
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62027:106"/>when they leave God, and adhere to the creature: that the following words make out, <hi>becauſe they have forſaken the Lord, the fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters.</hi> When men forſake the living God, and imbrace dying crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then they depart from God. Now all ſuch ſhall be written in the earth:
<note place="margin">

The Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>No covetous perſon, which is an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath any inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt and of God, Epheſ.</hi> 5. Or we may underſtand it thus: <hi>They ſhall be written in the earth;</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever account and eſtimation men may be of in this world, they ſhall be of no account above with God and the holy Angels; their <hi>names ſhall be written in the earth:</hi> they love the earth, and all the honour they ſhall
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62027:106"/>have, it ſhall be upon the earth: their honor and eſteem ſhall not go beyond this world. Earthly - minded men that leave great Eſtates, Dignities and Honours behinde them, they may be famous in the Records and Annals of this world; they may be renowned for their riches, and the great things they have enjoyed here: but this is all they ſhall have, they ſhall have no eſtimation in the upper world, their name ſhall not and dye on the earth; they ſhall have no honour, nor carry any eſteem in the heavenly Country.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Conſider, there is much of vanity and vexation in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: We know whoſe words they are; <hi>All is vanity and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirit.</hi> Firſt, earthly things are vain things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is not in them that which they promiſe to us. Earthly things promiſe much more then we finde to be in them, when we come to try them: We think to finde much more good, ſweetneſs, and contentment in theſe things, then indeed we finde in them, when we
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62027:107"/>come to experiment what is in them. Now that is a vain thing, which is empty of that it promiſeth; <hi>that is called vain,
<note place="margin">Vanum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur quod re ipſâ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituitur.</note> which is deſtitute of ſolidity and ſubſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They can never <hi>ſatisfie</hi> us; now whatſoever cannot ſatisfie is <hi>vain.</hi> Happineſs lyes in ſatisfaction: hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſts in having all the good a man would have, in having all the good that he deſires: while there is any good a man would have, and doth deſire, and hath it not, he is not happy. Now there is no man, by the enjoyment of any or all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, that hath all the good he would have; and therefore he is far from ſatisfaction, far from hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Earthly things, as they are <hi>vain,</hi> ſo they are <hi>vexations;</hi> the <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>travail</hi> in getting them, the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>ſollicitude</hi> in keeping them, the <hi>fear</hi> of looſing them, the <hi>grief</hi> that follows upon the looſing of them, the <hi>defectiveneſs</hi> of ſomething or other in them when we have the greateſt abundance of them, <hi>the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſes</hi> that are mingled with them,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62027:107"/>bring a great deal of vexation into earthly things. When men are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with inordinate love of earthly things, <hi>they pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows.
<note place="margin">Qui mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danis ſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat, tela parat, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatur.</note> He that intangles himſelf with worldly things, doth but provide darts for himſelf, by which he is thruſt through. Auſtin</hi> in a diſcourſe of his about the contempt of the world, hath a paſſage to this purpoſe. <hi>The bands of this world have a true ſharpneſs; but a falſe ſweetneſs; a certain grief, but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pleaſure; hard labour, timerous and fearful quiet; they are full of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but empty of happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the mordinate love of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things doth greatly unfit us for communion with God here, and for the enjoyment of him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It unfits us for communion with God here. God will not be aſſable and familiar with that perſon, who deſires, prizeth, loves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in any thing more then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The way to enjoy moſt of God, is to be taken more with God himſelf then with other things: When we
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62027:108"/>are more taken with God himſelf, then with all his gifts; when we are inamoured of the Lord himſelf, and God is more ſweet to us then all things that come from him: this is the way to enjoy moſt of God. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me.</hi> If we love God himſelf more then his gifts, then ſhall we know what it is to be loved of him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>If any man love me, he ſhall he loved of my Father, and I will love him,</hi> &amp;c. but if we laviſh out our hearts upon earthly things, and have great and admiring thoughts of them, and are vigorous in our purſuit of them, and God hath the leaſt part of our thoughts and affections; God cares not for ſuch lovers; neither may ſuch expect to attain to any friendſhip or familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity with him here on earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The love of earthly things, as it unfits us for communion with God here, ſo it unfits us for the enjoyment of him hereafter. In heaven, the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul ſhall be immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon God; the ſoul will be wholly taken up in contemplating, admiring,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62027:108"/>loving, delighting in God, in praiſing and adoring of him. Now when the heart is wholly taken up with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, it is altogether unfitted and indiſpoſed for ſuch a life. The ſoul is coloured, as it were, with the objects that it converſeth with, and receives a tincture and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from them. A man whoſe ſpirit is immers'd and drenched in the world, will be very unfit to have the faculties of his ſoul carryed forth upon God. The beſt way to have our ſouls ſuited and adapted to the future life, it is to keep our ſpirits at as great a diſtance as may be from preſent things. We ſhould be ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often in our own ſouls: Oh the bleſſed ſtate, Oh the bleſſed life that is above! Oh to ſee God, to love him, to go to him, to live with him, in his eternity! How ſweet is that life! When we are without thoſe earthly things which we deſire, we ſhould ſay, our true life, our true happineſs is above, where there ſhall be no more need or uſe of theſe things: when we have the moſt of theſe things, our hearts ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62027:109"/>up above theſe things, and ſay, We expect, and look for, and long after another happineſs; a happineſs that is above theſe things. We ſhould keep our hearts in the moſt reſerved frame for the future life, and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate: We ſhould not ſuffer our ſpirits to mingle too far with preſent things: Our hearts ſhould ſit ſo looſe to preſent things, that we may be ready to lay down theſe things, and to take up with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that is above. If we ſuffer our ſpirits to launch forth too far into the world, it will be a hard matter to reduce them: and when the cry is made, <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him;</hi> we ſhall be very unfit to entertain his Call: If our ſouls ſtick, and be taken up in the things of time, we ſhall be very unfit and unready to deliver them up into eternity.</p>

            <p n="1">I.

            <p n="7">VII.

The Word gives us ſome glimpſes of the heavenly ſtate: the Word tells us, that we ſhall be <hi>preſent with the Lord.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. <hi>Abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord.</hi> The Word tells us, that <hi>we ſhall be ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.17. The Word tells us, we <hi>ſhall ſee God,</hi> Matth. 5.8. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> The Word tells us, <hi>we ſhall be like him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. The Word tells us, that <hi>our vile bodies ſhall be made like unto his glorious body,</hi> Phil. 3.21. The Word tells us, that <hi>all tears ſhall be wiped away from our eyes,</hi> Rev. 21.4. and that <hi>everlaſting joy ſhall be upon our heads,</hi> Iſai. 35.10. Theſe things, and much more, doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeak of the glory of the future life. Now our thoughts and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſhould work on theſe things. He that hath a fair inheritance left him, will be willing ſome time or other to go to ſee it: we have the heavenly inheritance given to us, <hi>an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4.</note> and that fadeth not away, reſerved in the heavens for us.</hi> Now ſince there is ſo
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62027:118"/>great an inheritance reſerved for us, we ſhould not ſlight it, but be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as often as may be, to take a proſpect of it by faith. Nothing is ſo ſweet as the contemplation of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things: the contemplation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things is much more ſweet then the higheſt enjoyment of preſent ſenſible things. Eternal things ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and quiet the minde; no temporal thing can do it: let us then lay hold on eternal life in this ſence: let us keep our thoughts fixt and intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To lay hold on eternal life, it is to <hi>purſue after it in our endeavours.</hi> As the bent and tendencie of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſhould lie towards eternal life, ſo we ſhould purſue after it in our endeavours. <hi>Lay hold on eternal life.</hi>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62027:118"/>in Chriſt too much, that we can love God too much, that we can be too much in obedience and holy walking, ſo we may but attain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life in the end. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life.</hi> The meaning is: God will certainly give and beſtow eternal life on them who by a patient continuance in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeek for it. But we may not miſtake here; we ought not to think that God gives us eternal life upon the account of the <hi>merit</hi> of any thing that we do; it is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obedience of Chriſt onely, that gives us a right and a title to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life. But thus we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it: This is the race and courſe that God hath appointed us to run; God hath appointed us to run this courſe and race of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience here on earth, that ſo we may come to eternal life in the end. Hence is that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith.</hi> What then? <hi>Henceforth there is laid
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62027:119"/>up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day; and not to me onely, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> Certainly <hi>Paul</hi> did not expect eternal life upon the merit of his obedience, or of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; but <hi>Paul</hi> knew that God had appointed him ſuch a courſe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to run here on earth; and his courſe being finiſhed, he knew that God would be faithful to give him the Crown. God hath propounded and ſet before us the Crown of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: it becomes us to purſue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Crown with our uttermoſt endeavours, that we may attain it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful to the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</hi> O how ſweet, how unexpreſſibly ſweet will it be, to be ſure of eternal life when this natural life fails!

            <p n="5">5. To lay hold on eternal life, it is <hi>to live much in the hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal life.</hi> Titus 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promiſed before the world began.</hi> Rom. 5.2. <hi>We rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God.</hi> The main of our hopes ſhould not lie in this world, we ſhould not fancie to our ſelves, and expect an happineſs here on earth: but our great hope ſhould be above; we ſhould <hi>caſt anchor within the veil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6.19.</note> expect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in what is to be enjoyed on the other ſide of time. If the main of our hopes and expectation be in this life, we and our hopes are like to periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for we our ſelves muſt die, and the things we hope for, and make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of as our happineſs, they muſt die and periſh: it is good therefore to have ſuch an hope as will not fail us, nor deceive us. If we look for the main of our happineſs, yea our onely true happineſs in the next world, not in this world; this is ſuch
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62027:120"/>a hope as will never deceive us. A man that hath fixt his hopes in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, when he hath loſt any temporal thing, the main of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is ſtill where it was: his hopes and expectations were carried above this world, and therefore whatſoever his loſſes and diſappointments were here on earth, this doth not ſhake his happineſs: his happineſs was placed elſewhere before, and he is at the ſame point ſtill.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To lay hold on eternal life, it is, <hi>not to ſuffer the comfort of eternal life to be wreſted from us.</hi> As we ought to live much in the hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of eternal life; ſo we ought to take comfort in the hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of eternal life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Rejoycing in hope.</hi> As we ought to <hi>hope</hi> for eternal life; ſo we ought to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the hope of eternal life. I conceive that much of the force of the Text lies here: <hi>Lay hold on eternal life unto which thou art called, and haſt made a good profeſſion before many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi> It is as much as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid, Thou haſt a true and an undoubted <hi>title</hi> to eternal life, thou
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62027:120"/>haſt a firm ſure <hi>title</hi> to eternal life; thy vocation and calling as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntitles thee to eternal life: <hi>Lay hold on eternal life, unto which thou art called:</hi> that eminent profeſſion of faith which thou haſt made as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and as a Miniſter, both in thy life and doctrine; this gives an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proof of thy right and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to eternal life. Now this is the force of the Apoſtles argument: Since thou haſt ſo firm a title to eternal life, lay claim to it as thy own; live in the hope and comfort of it, and do not ſuffer the comfort of eternal life to be wreſted from thee. Much of the meaning of the Text ſeems to be contained in this. The Greek word, as it ſignifies to purſue after a thing, ſo alſo to <hi>hold it faſt,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it</hi> when once we have gotten it. So that the deſigne of the Apoſtle is to perſwade <hi>Timothy</hi> to hold firm and faſt the hope of eternal life; not to part with the hope of ſalvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any terms. <hi>Lay hold on eternal life:</hi> it is as much as if it had been ſaid, Do not part with thy hopes of ſalvation and eternal life upon any
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62027:121"/>terms. The ſtedfaſt aſſured hope of ſalvation, is the great thing that muſt carry us thorow the difficulties, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and afflictions of our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage here on earth. Therefore doth the Apoſtle exhort the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that they would <hi>take for an helmet the hope of ſalvation,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.8. <hi>Putting on the breſtplate of faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of ſalvation.</hi> Intimating thus much, that if they had a well-grounded hope of ſalvation, this would fortifie them againſt all the afflictions they were to meet with here by the way. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever afflictions, ſufferings and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles we meet with here in this world, if we can caſt an eye to the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly country,</hi> and ſee that we have a part there, all is well above: there is none of thoſe troubles, fears, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, where the main of our hope, happineſs, and expectation lies. Therefore let us not part with or let go the comfort of eternal life: if we part with the comfort of eternal life, we loſe that which muſt be the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort of our life: nothing can bear us up under the afflictions of this
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62027:121"/>life, but the ſolid well-grounded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of eternal life.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To <hi>lay holy of eternal life,</hi> it is to look after the <hi>firſt fruits of the ſpirit,</hi> and to labour after an <hi>inchoate poſſeſſion</hi> of eternal life in our ſouls here on earth. Our Saviour teacheth us, <hi>He that eateth his fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his bloud hath eternal life.</hi> Joh. 6.54. He <hi>hath it,</hi> that is, he hath it in the beginning of it. And concerning his Sheep, he ſaith, <hi>I give them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> Joh. 10. He ſpeaks in the <hi>preſent</hi> tenſe, what he doth do for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: <hi>I give unto them eternal life.</hi> Chriſt hath already made over eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to his people, he hath given them a right and a title to it, and he hath given them the beginning of it in their ſouls here on earth: it is a great Text, Joh. 4.14. <hi>The water that I ſhall give, ſhall be a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> The plain meaning ſeems to be, that Grace, and that of the Spirit of God which Chriſt hath given to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here on earth, ſhall never leave them till it hath brought them to eternal life. The Spirit of God that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62027:122"/>is in the hearts of the Saints, and the Grace of Godwhich is wrought in them, ſhall nover leave them till it hath brought them to eternal life. Hence it is that the Spirit of God is called <hi>the earneſt of our inheritance, Eph.</hi> 1.14. an earneſt is part of the bargain: the Spirit of God that dwells in the hearts of Believers, is an <hi>earnoſt</hi> of eternal glory: for what is heaven, but a fuller manifeſtation of the Spirit of God in us, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts and puts it ſelf forth in part in us here on earth? So that ſo far as we are ſenſible of the indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Spirit of God, and the operation of it in our ſouls; ſo far we have an carneſt of eternal glory. This is that <hi>water</hi> which ſhall be a <hi>well of water ſpringing up into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> We ſhould labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſenſible of the indwelling of the Spirit, and of the operation of the Spirit of God in us, in a way of grace and of comfort. In this ſenſe we ſhould <hi>lay hold of eternal life;</hi> that is, we ſhould be earneſtly preſſing and making after it in our own ſouls: we ſhould pray carneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62027:122"/>that God would let down more of eternal life into our ſouls here on earth: As he once ſaid, <hi>Lord come down to me, or take me up to thee.</hi> We ſhould pray that eternal life may come down more into our ſouls here on earth: This ſhould be the higheſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of a Chriſtian, to perceive and feel more of the dawnings &amp; puttings forth of eternal life in his ſoul here on earth. It is not impoſſible for us to perceive and feel the dawnings and puttings forth of eternal life in our ſouls here on earth; and this is that we ſhould earneſtly pray for. Someof the laſt words of Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> were theſe: <hi>Glory, glory, dwells in Emmanuels land.</hi> We ſhould pray for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſights and proſpects that may be of the heavenly glory: The clearer ſights we can get of eternal things, the more ſhall we finde our hearts crucified to the things of time, and the more ſhall we finde our hearts carried up aloft to thoſe things that are above, even whilſt we are fain to uſe theſe other things for our preſent neceſſitie.</p>

The greateſt part of men think not on eternal things; they live as if they were always to live here on earth: they never think of a future ſtate, nor do they provide for it. But if we ought to <hi>lay hold of eternal life;</hi> if that ought to be the mark and ſcope in our eye, that ſhews that we are far wide of that which ought to be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62027:127"/>our true mark and ſcope; when we are wholly taken up with temporal things, and neglect eternal.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We are to be reprehended, that we are ſo much addicted to the <hi>love of this life.</hi> We are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love eternal life, and to lay hold on that, but we are found of this life, and loth to part with it. He is a rare ſoul, that is ſatisfied with life here on earth, and hath ſuch an apprehenſion of the reality and excellencie of eternal life, that this life groweth out of eſteem with him. I grant that this natural life is a bleſſing, as other temporal bleſſings are; but as it is poſſible for us to love other things too much; ſo it is poſſible, yea, too common to love this life too much; and it is the wiſdom of God to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter this life to us by many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe we are ſo fond of it; and that he may weary us out of it, and cauſe us to long for that which is the true life. <hi>Vita longa, long a infirmitas;</hi> a long life is a long infirmity; and we may adde, <hi>Longa tentatio,</hi> a long temptation. What is our whole life, but a life of tryals and temptations?
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62027:127"/>It is true, we may value and prize life for theſe two ends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To work out our Salvation, to make ready for the coming of the Bridegroom</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may do ſome work and ſervice for God; that we may glorifie him upon the earth, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the work that he hath given us to do. But to be over-fond of this life meerly for lifes ſake, is a certain ſigne of unbelief: It is a ſigne we have little knowledge of another life, little acquaintance with eternal life. Had we a proſpect by faith of a better and more excellent life, we ſhould not be ſo over fond of this life.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> 2. By way of <hi>Exhortation;</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us all to put the duty of the Text in practice. Let us labour to <hi>lay hold on eternal life.</hi> Oh! let us labour to call up our hearts from <hi>viſible</hi> things to <hi>inviſible,</hi> from <hi>preſent</hi> things to <hi>future,</hi> from <hi>momentary</hi> things to <hi>eternal:</hi> the things of the other world are never the leſs real, becauſe they are out of ſight. Atheiſts think that eternal life and all future things are but a fiction; but we may uſe to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62027:128"/>them that Speech of <hi>Cyprian:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In aeternam poenam ſerò tandem cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, qui in aeternam vitam cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</note> They ſhall believe too late to their eternal torment, who would not believe to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> But let Atheiſts and Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſay what they pleaſe; we do know, or ought to know, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is the greateſt reality. <hi>God that cannot lye, hath promiſed us eternal life, Titus</hi> 1.2. The great promiſe of the Goſpel is eternal life. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25. <hi>This is the promiſe that he hath given to us, eternal life.</hi> Unleſs we make God to be a lyar, we muſt take eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life for the greateſt reality. In the proſecution of this Uſe, I ſhall onely propound ſome Directions for the better putting in practice of this duty, to ſhew us how we ought to <hi>lay hold of eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us have great and admiring thoughts of eternal life: We ſhould labour to have our hearts raiſed up with the conſideration of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of this life.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quanta erit illa fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitas, ubi nullum erit malum, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum latebit bonum?</hi> Aug. <hi>Civit. Dei.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>How great ſhall that happineſs be, where there ſhall be no evil preſent, and no good ſhall be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> where we ſhall be wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the praiſes of God, and God ſhall be <hi>all in all;</hi> we ſhall <hi>ſee and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62027:128"/>love, love and praiſe,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it. This natural life which now we live, is not worth the name of life in compariſon of eternal life: nay, it deſerves to be called a death, rather then a life; for we always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about ſin with us, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; cauſe of death. But in <hi>eternal life</hi> we ſhall not onely be free from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but from ſin the cauſe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; yea, we ſhall be free from the poſſibility of ſinning. Mans firſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the ſtate of Innocencie, was <hi>poſſe non peccare,</hi> a power not to have ſinned: His laſt happineſs in Heaven, is <hi>non poſſe peccare,</hi> not to be able to ſin at all: Though man in his firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was endowed with ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that he might not have ſinned; yet it was poſſible for him to ſin, and he did ſin: but in <hi>eternal life,</hi> the will ſhall be ſo confirmed, as that there ſhall not be a poſſibility of ſinning. Oh! how great will that happineſs be, when the ſoul ſhall enjoy the ſweetneſs of eternal joys without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion? when the ſoul ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all its ſins and ſorrows, as to any ſenſe or experience of them; yet not ſo as to be unthankful to him, who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62027:129"/>hath been its Saviour and Deliverer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould breathe, long, and ſuſpire after eternal life. We ſhould elevate and lift up our hearts above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and this lower world, &amp; breathe after the ſweetneſs and delights of the Heavenly Country. Thoſe breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are in the hearts of the Saints after eternal things,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cum ſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus res coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtes, tum ſentimus perpetuò aliquid gaudii &amp; voluptatis.</hi> Roloc. <hi>in</hi> Joh.</note> give them ſome taſte of thoſe things: <hi>When we thirſt after heavenly things,</hi> ſaith a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Divine, <hi>we do always perceive and experiment ſomething of joy and ſweetneſs.</hi> Thoſe breathings that are in the hearts of the Saints after eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, are ſome of the firſt fruits of the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. <hi>We our ſelves which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our bodies.</hi> Other men feel no ſuch longings and breathings as theſe are: for although there be a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in all men which carries them out to deſire happineſs, yet none but the Saints long and breathe after the enjoyment of God as their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Therefore ſo far as we finde a thirſt kindled in our ſouls after the ſight and enjoyment of God in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62027:129"/>life, ſo far we have an earneſt of eternal life in our ſouls. How great a thing ſhould it be to us, to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſight of the Divine Majeſty! <hi>to be taken up from the light of the Sun and Moon, to the light of him who made the Sun and the Moon;</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it. It is a good obſervation of <hi>Luther: How much joy is there when God doth exhibit by the Word one drop of conſolation to ſuch as are tempted and afflicted in conſcience! but far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and unexpreſſible will that joy be, when the God of all conſolation ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf, and ſhall wholly pour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf forth unto us in eternal life.</hi> How ſhould we breathe after this life?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us <hi>place our happineſs, and expect it no where, but in eternal life.</hi> We ſhould carry our hope and expectation above this world; and never expect to finde happineſs,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ipſe finis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorum, qui ſins fine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dehitur, ſine faſtidio a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabitur, ſine fatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabitur.</hi> Aug.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we come to live with God in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. <hi>He ſhall be the end of our deſires, who ſhall be ſeen without end, loved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nauſeouſneſs praiſed without weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs. This is life eternal,</hi> &amp;c. It is a vain thing to expect happineſs until we come to ſee God, and to live with him in his eternity. If the Lord make
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62027:130"/>our paſſage in any meaſure tolerable thorow this world, this is a mercy: if he give us any comfort in outward things in this world, theſe are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſo far as he is ſeen and loved in them: otherwiſe, the beſt comforts here on earth are pitiful things: for what can be <hi>truely good,</hi> from which the <hi>chief good</hi> is abſent? <hi>Deus eſt omnis boni bonum;</hi> God is the <hi>good of every good;</hi> and nothing is good, but as he appears in it. But we ought to remember, that our true and great happineſs is to live in the <hi>Divine preſence</hi> above, and to have the ſight of God to eternity. And it is not poſſible that any ſoul that hath had one glimpſe, or one true taſte of him, ſhould think any thing to be happineſs ſhort of that ſight. This therefore is to lay hold of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, to keep our ſpirits aloof off from the world as much as may be, and to keep our ſpirits reſerved for the enjoyment of God in eternal life. The enjoyment of God in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, is the point and centre that we ſhould be moving and tending unto. When the Lord gives us any of the comforts and bleſſings of this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62027:130"/>life; when he gives us eſtates, friends, the comfort of relations; we ſhould ſay, Theſe are the gifts of God, and ſo far they are good; but theſe are not my happineſs: my happineſs is God himſelf; my happineſs is to ſee him, and to live with him in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Here ſhould our deſires reſt and terminate: and though we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire and uſe many things for neceſſity in the preſent ſtate, yet our deſire and expectation ſhould be ſtill carried above theſe things, and end no where but in the enjoyment of God.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quis alius noſter eſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, niſi per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire ad regnum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus nullus eſt finis?</hi> Aug.</note> 
               <hi>What other end have we, but to come to that kingdom, of which there is no end?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, we ſhould labour to be in a <hi>readineſs and preparedneſs of ſpirit</hi> to enter upon eternal life. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace without ſpot and blame.</hi> Our ambition ſhould be, to be found in ſuch a poſture, and to keep our ſouls in ſuch an holy evenneſs, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may impede or hinder our free paſſage out of Time into Eternity. We ſhould labour to keep our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences pure. We ſhould ſee that the guilt of no ſin remain upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62027:131"/>unpardoned, unrepented of. We ſhould ſee that our affections be not intangled with the inordinate love of lawful things, much leſs with the love of any ſin. We ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have our hearts fortified with a ſtedfaſt belief of the things God hath promiſed us in the other world: the weakneſs of our faith in believing the things promiſed, makes us very unfit for the enjoyment of eternal life. We ſhould often contemplate eternal life, we ſhould be thinking of it night &amp; day: all the comforts that we enjoy, all the neceſſary employments we are engaged in, ſhould not take us off from the frequent meditation of eternal life. What ſo neceſſary to be thought of, as that ſtate, which when once it is begun, ſhall never have an end? This whole life is but like one long dream, in compariſon of eternal life. Oh! let us not forget eternal life, but be ſtill preparing and making ready for it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, we ſhould not <hi>take up,</hi> or <hi>reſt ſatisfied</hi> with what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained in grace; but preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward that which lies before
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62027:131"/>us, and is yet wanting to us. This is the direction the Apoſtle gives us from his own example, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe things which are behinde, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſs toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus. Paul</hi>'s aim and ſcope was to obtain the prize: what prize was that? the prize of eternal glory. This is all one as to lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. How would he do this? what courſe doth he take to attain this? He <hi>forgets the things that are behinde, and reacheth forth toward the things that are before.</hi> What are the things that are behinde? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes he had already made in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, his former attainments in grace. He had ſome knowledge of Chriſt, ſome love to Chriſt, ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Chriſts love to him; he had done ſome ſervice for Chriſt: <hi>Paul</hi> forgets theſe things; and what then? He <hi>preſſeth after thoſe things that are before.</hi> What is that? He preſſeth after that knowledge, that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62027:132"/>love, that obedience, that conformity to Chriſt, which he had not attained to. When we have attained moſt grace, moſt knowledge, moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet there is more ſtill to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Now we ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be ſtretching forth, (an emphatical word) <hi>reaching forth, ſtretching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, extending our ſelves:</hi> do as Racers do when they are come near the mark, ſtretch forth themſelves to reach the mark, and touch the gold. So ſhould we be aſpiring and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to come to as great a propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and neerneſs in our ſpirits in point of grace, to the future life, and the future ſtate, as may be here on earth. We ſhould ſtrain hard to get as great a ſutableneſs and conformity to the future life as may be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, we ſhould pray that we may be in ſuch a frame, as that we may be willing to leave this world, and to part with this life, that we may go to live with God in eternal life. We ſhould be willing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live while God would have us live, and while he hath any work for us to do: but when our work is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62027:132"/>done, and the Lord calls for us, we ſhould not be ſo fond of this world, and of this life, but we ſhould be willing to relinquiſh the one and the other, to go to live with God in his eternity. What can be to us that which God will be to us? Do we finde comfort in meat, in drink, in rayment, in friends, in riches, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? God will be much more to us.
